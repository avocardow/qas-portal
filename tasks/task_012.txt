# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create CI Validation for Permissions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop CI checks to ensure all permission constants in code are represented in the database.
# Details:
1. Create a CI script that extracts all permission checks from the codebase
2. Compare these against the permissions in the database
3. Fail the build if any permissions are missing from the database
4. Generate a report of unused permissions
5. Add the script to the CI pipeline
6. Document the process for adding new permissions
7. Create a guide for developers on how to properly use the permission system

# Test Strategy:
Test the CI script with known mismatches to verify it correctly identifies missing or unused permissions. Ensure it integrates properly with the CI pipeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Script to Extract and Compare Permission Constants [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a script that scans the codebase to extract all permission constants and compares them against the permissions stored in the database.
### Details:
Implement a script (e.g., in Python, Node.js, or your project's primary language) that parses the codebase to identify all permission constants used in permission checks. Connect to the database and retrieve the list of permissions. Compare the two sets to identify any permissions present in code but missing from the database. Ensure the script outputs a clear summary of missing permissions.

## 2. Implement CI Build Failure on Missing Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate the extraction and comparison script into the CI pipeline so that the build fails if any permissions used in code are missing from the database.
### Details:
Add the script to the CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins). Configure the pipeline to run the script as part of the validation steps. Ensure the CI job fails with an appropriate error message if missing permissions are detected, preventing merges or deployments until the issue is resolved.

## 3. Generate and Report Unused Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Enhance the script to identify permissions present in the database but not referenced in the code, and generate a report listing these unused permissions.
### Details:
Extend the comparison logic to also detect permissions that exist in the database but are not used anywhere in the codebase. Output these as a separate section in the script's report, making it easy for developers or administrators to review and clean up obsolete permissions.

## 4. Document Permission Validation Workflow and Developer Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the permission validation process, including instructions for adding new permissions and guidelines for developers on using the permission system.
### Details:
Write clear documentation describing how the CI permission validation works, how to add new permissions to both code and database, and best practices for using the permission system. Include troubleshooting steps for common issues and a guide for interpreting the CI reports. Make this documentation accessible to all developers (e.g., in the project wiki or docs folder).
