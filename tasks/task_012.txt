# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Form Validation and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive form validation and error handling across all forms and API interactions.
# Details:
1. Implement client-side validation for all forms using a validation library or custom logic
2. Add appropriate error messages for validation failures
3. Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
4. Implement toast notifications for success and error states
5. Add loading indicators during API calls
6. Ensure all forms maintain state during validation errors

# Test Strategy:
Test validation by submitting invalid data in all forms. Verify error messages display correctly. Test API error handling by simulating API failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up validation library and create validation schemas [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and integrate a validation library (Yup or Zod recommended) and define reusable validation schemas for all form types in the application.
### Details:
1. Install the chosen validation library (e.g., `npm install yup` or `npm install zod`)
2. Create a dedicated `/validation` directory to house all validation schemas
3. Define base validation schemas for common fields (email, password, names, etc.) with appropriate rules and error messages
4. Create form-specific schemas by composing base schemas
5. Ensure schemas enforce standardized data formats
6. Add TypeScript types that align with validation schemas
7. Test schemas with various inputs to verify validation rules work as expected

## 2. Implement client-side form validation with real-time feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate the validation schemas with form components to provide real-time, inline validation feedback as users interact with form fields.
### Details:
1. Integrate validation schemas with React Hook Form or Formik
2. Implement field-level validation that triggers on blur and input events
3. Add debouncing for real-time validation to prevent excessive validation calls
4. Display inline error messages adjacent to form fields
5. Style error states for form inputs (red borders, error icons, etc.)
6. Ensure validation maintains form state when errors occur
7. Add accessibility attributes (aria-invalid, aria-describedby) for screen readers
8. Test validation with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## 3. Create error handling utilities for API interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop utility functions to standardize API error handling across the application, mapping server errors to user-friendly messages.
### Details:
1. Create an `apiErrorHandler.ts` utility
2. Implement functions to parse and normalize error responses from different API endpoints
3. Define a standard error response format
4. Create a mapping of error codes/types to user-friendly messages
5. Add support for field-specific errors returned from the server
6. Implement retry logic for transient errors when appropriate
7. Add logging for errors to aid debugging
8. Test with mocked API responses to verify correct error handling

## 4. Implement toast notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a toast notification system to display success and error messages across the application.
### Details:
1. Select a toast library (e.g., react-toastify, react-hot-toast) or implement a custom solution
2. Create a Toast context/provider to manage toast state
3. Implement different toast types (success, error, warning, info)
4. Add customizable duration, position, and dismissal options
5. Ensure toasts are accessible (can be dismissed with keyboard, readable by screen readers)
6. Style toasts to match application design system
7. Create utility functions for common toast operations
8. Test toast functionality across different screen sizes

## 5. Add loading indicators and API request state management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement loading indicators and state management for API requests to provide visual feedback during form submissions and data fetching.
### Details:
1. Create reusable loading components (spinners, skeleton loaders, etc.)
2. Implement a request state management system (loading, success, error states)
3. Add loading indicators to form submit buttons that disable during submission
4. Implement full-page or section loading states for initial data fetching
5. Add progress indicators for multi-step forms or file uploads
6. Ensure loading states preserve form data to prevent data loss
7. Add appropriate aria attributes for accessibility during loading states
8. Test loading indicators with simulated slow network connections

## 6. Integrate all components into a complete form validation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Connect all previously built components into a cohesive system and apply it across all application forms with server-side validation.
### Details:
1. Create a FormWrapper component that combines validation, error handling, loading states, and toast notifications
2. Implement server-side validation that mirrors client-side schemas
3. Synchronize error messages between client and server validation
4. Add form submission handlers that properly manage the entire submission lifecycle
5. Implement form state persistence during validation errors
6. Create comprehensive documentation for the validation system
7. Apply the complete system to all forms in the application
8. Write integration tests that verify the entire form submission flow from validation to success/error handling
