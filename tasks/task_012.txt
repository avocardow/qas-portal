# Task ID: 12
# Title: Optimize Performance and Finalize UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize data loading, implement responsive design, and conduct final testing.
# Details:
Optimize data loading with pagination, lazy-loading, and Suspense boundaries for non-critical sections. Implement responsive design adjustments for all components. Conduct accessibility (A11y) checks and fixes. Create Storybook stories and unit tests for key components. Address performance issues with data volume by using select queries and optimizing bundle size.

# Test Strategy:
Run performance tests to measure load times and identify bottlenecks. Test responsive behavior across devices. Conduct accessibility audit. Run unit tests and Storybook visual regression tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize Data Loading and Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement efficient data loading strategies and address performance bottlenecks related to large data volumes.
### Details:
Apply pagination and lazy-loading for long lists using techniques such as windowing (e.g., react-window or react-virtualized). Use React.lazy and Suspense boundaries to defer loading of non-critical components. Optimize bundle size with code-splitting and dynamic imports. Refactor data queries to use select queries that fetch only necessary fields. Apply memoization (useMemo, React.memo) to reduce unnecessary re-renders and computations.[1][2][5]

## 2. Implement Responsive and Accessible UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Ensure all UI components are responsive across devices and meet accessibility (A11y) standards.
### Details:
Update CSS and layout logic to support responsive design for all components (e.g., using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries). Conduct accessibility checks (using tools like axe or Lighthouse) and fix issues such as missing ARIA attributes, insufficient color contrast, and keyboard navigation. Adjust UI elements to maintain usability and accessibility on different screen sizes.

## 3. Finalize UI with Storybook and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create Storybook stories and implement unit tests for key components, ensuring UI consistency and reliability.
### Details:
Develop comprehensive Storybook stories for all major UI components, covering various states and interactions. Write unit tests for critical components and logic using a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library). Verify that all performance, responsiveness, and accessibility optimizations are preserved during testing. Address any regressions or issues identified.
