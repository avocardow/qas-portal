# Task ID: 16
# Title: Optimize Performance and Implement Final Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize data loading, implement Suspense boundaries, and conduct comprehensive testing for the Client Profile page.
# Details:
Optimize data loading with select queries and pagination where appropriate. Implement Suspense boundaries for non-critical sections to improve perceived performance. Add lazy-loading for heavy components. Conduct comprehensive testing including accessibility checks, responsive design verification, and performance benchmarking. Create Storybook stories and unit tests for key components. Ensure all Cursor rules are followed.

# Test Strategy:
Run comprehensive test suite covering all components and features. Perform accessibility audit using automated tools. Test performance with large data sets. Verify responsive behavior across all breakpoints. Conduct end-to-end testing of key user flows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Data Loading Optimizations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize data fetching patterns with select queries and pagination to improve initial load times and reduce unnecessary network requests.
### Details:
Analyze current data fetching patterns and implement select queries to retrieve only needed fields. Add pagination for large data sets with configurable page sizes (20-50 items per page). Implement infinite scrolling or 'load more' patterns for long lists using windowing techniques like react-window or react-virtualized to render only visible items. Add request caching for frequently accessed data. Measure performance improvements using React DevTools Profiler and network monitoring tools.

## 2. Implement Code Splitting and Suspense Boundaries [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Reduce initial bundle size and improve perceived performance through code splitting, lazy loading, and strategic Suspense boundary placement.
### Details:
Use React.lazy() and dynamic imports to split the application into smaller chunks. Identify heavy components (complex forms, data visualizations, rich text editors) and configure them for lazy loading. Implement Suspense boundaries around non-critical UI sections with appropriate fallback components. Add prefetching for anticipated user paths to improve navigation experience. Consider implementing skeleton screens for content that takes longer to load. Ensure error boundaries are in place to gracefully handle loading failures.

## 3. Conduct Comprehensive Testing and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Perform thorough testing across multiple dimensions and create documentation for key components.
### Details:
Create Storybook stories for all key components with different states and variations. Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library focusing on critical user flows. Perform accessibility testing using axe or similar tools to ensure WCAG compliance. Test responsive design across multiple device sizes and orientations. Conduct performance benchmarking using Lighthouse and WebPageTest, establishing baseline metrics for First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive, and Total Blocking Time. Document performance optimization techniques used and create guidelines for maintaining performance. Verify all Cursor rules are followed throughout the codebase.
