# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Client Management Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Client List and Detail pages with CRUD functionality
# Details:
Develop: 1) Client List page (/clients) with functional data table using client.getAll, including pagination, sorting, filtering, and conditional 'Add New Client' button based on user role. 2) Client Detail page (/clients/[clientId]) with structured Cards/Tabs for Contacts, Licenses, Trust Accounts, Audit History, and Activity Log. 3) Client Create/Edit forms using React Hook Form + Zod with template components, handling client.create and client.update. Use Tailwind and Shadcn UI / TailAdmin components for consistent styling.

# Test Strategy:
Perform manual testing of all UI components and interactions. Verify data fetching, pagination, sorting, and filtering. Test form validation and submission. Confirm role-based UI element visibility.

### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create reusable forms for adding and editing clients using React Hook Form and Zod for schema validation.
### Details:
Build form components using template components and consistent styling (Tailwind, Shadcn UI/TailAdmin). Integrate React Hook Form for state management and Zod for validation. Connect forms to client.create and client.update methods. Handle form submission, error states, and success feedback.
