# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement View Action Button
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a View button/icon to each row that navigates to the client detail page
# Details:
1. Create a row action component with a View button/icon
2. Configure the button to navigate to /clients/[clientId] on click
3. Integrate the action component into DataTableTwo's row actions slot
4. Apply appropriate styling according to Cursor rules
5. Ensure the action is visible to all roles (Admin, Manager, Client)
6. Remove any existing row-level delete functionality

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation to client detail page works correctly. Verify the button appears for all user roles. Check that styling matches design system requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ViewActionButton component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a reusable ViewActionButton component that will be used across the application for navigating to detail pages.
### Details:
Create a new component in the shared components directory that accepts clientId as a prop. Use semantic HTML with a button element for accessibility. Implement an eye/visibility icon from the project's icon library. Add appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers. Include a tooltip that appears on hover with 'View Details' text. Style according to Cursor design system with appropriate contrast and visual hierarchy as a secondary action. Ensure the button is keyboard accessible and has proper focus states. Test the component in isolation to verify it renders correctly.

## 2. Implement navigation functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add navigation logic to the ViewActionButton component to direct users to the client detail page when clicked.
### Details:
Import and use the application's routing mechanism (likely React Router's useNavigate hook). Implement an onClick handler that navigates to the '/clients/[clientId]' route, passing the clientId as a parameter. Add error handling to prevent navigation issues. Test the navigation functionality to ensure it correctly routes to the appropriate client detail page. Verify that the browser history is properly updated. Ensure that the button is not triggering form submissions if placed within a form context.

## 3. Integrate ViewActionButton with DataTableTwo [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Modify the DataTableTwo component to include the ViewActionButton in its row actions slot.
### Details:
Locate the DataTableTwo component and identify the row actions slot implementation. Add the ViewActionButton component to the row actions area, passing the appropriate clientId from the row data. Ensure the button is properly aligned with other action buttons if present. Maintain appropriate spacing between action buttons according to the design system. Test the integration to verify the button appears correctly in each row of the table. Ensure the component receives the correct clientId for each row.

## 4. Remove existing row-level delete functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Remove any existing delete buttons or functionality from the table rows as specified in the requirements.
### Details:
Identify and remove any delete buttons or icons from the row actions area. Remove any associated delete handlers or confirmation dialogs. Ensure that removing this functionality doesn't break any existing code. Update any tests that might be expecting delete functionality. Verify that the delete functionality is completely removed from the UI and that no orphaned code remains. Test to confirm that clicking on row actions doesn't trigger any delete-related behavior.

## 5. Implement responsive design for ViewActionButton [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Ensure the ViewActionButton is usable and accessible across all device sizes and screen resolutions.
### Details:
Add responsive styling to ensure the button is easily tappable on mobile devices (minimum touch target size of 44x44px). Implement media queries if necessary to adjust the button size or spacing on smaller screens. Test on various device sizes to ensure the button remains accessible and visually appealing. Verify that the tooltip appears correctly on both desktop and mobile devices. Ensure that the button doesn't overflow or cause layout issues on small screens. Test with touch interactions to verify mobile usability.

## 6. Configure role-based visibility [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Ensure the ViewActionButton is visible to all user roles (Admin, Manager, Client) as specified in the requirements.
### Details:
Review the application's role-based access control system. Verify that the ViewActionButton is not restricted by any role-based conditions. If necessary, explicitly configure the button to be visible to all roles. Test with different user roles to confirm visibility for Admin, Manager, and Client roles. Document the role-based visibility configuration for future reference. Ensure that while the button is visible to all roles, the navigation still respects any role-based access restrictions on the client detail page itself.

## 7. Write comprehensive tests for ViewActionButton functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Create unit and integration tests to ensure the ViewActionButton works correctly in all scenarios.
### Details:
Write unit tests for the ViewActionButton component to verify rendering and click behavior. Create integration tests to verify the button appears correctly in the DataTableTwo component. Test navigation to ensure clicking the button correctly routes to the client detail page. Verify accessibility by testing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. Test with different screen sizes to confirm responsive behavior. Verify role-based visibility by testing with different user roles. Include edge cases such as handling clients with missing IDs or other required data. Document test coverage and any assumptions made during testing.
