# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Permission Policy Definitions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the central policy file that maps actions to roles, serving as the single source of truth for permissions.
# Details:
1. Create a `policies/permissions.ts` (or JSON/YAML) file
2. Define the permission structure based on the selected library's syntax
3. Map each role (Developer, Admin, Manager, Auditor, Staff, Client) to their allowed actions
4. Include conditional permissions where needed
5. Document the schema and usage patterns
6. Ensure all permissions discovered in the audit are represented
7. Group permissions logically by feature area

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests that validate the policy file loads correctly and returns expected permissions for each role. Test edge cases like conditional permissions and role inheritance if applicable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Permission Schema and Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the schema and structure for the central permission policy file based on RBAC principles, ensuring it can represent all required roles and actions while supporting conditional permissions.
### Details:
1. Analyze the existing roles (Developer, Admin, Manager, Auditor, Staff, Client) and their required permissions
2. Choose between JSON, YAML, or TypeScript for the policy definition format (TypeScript recommended for type safety)
3. Design a schema that groups permissions logically by feature area
4. Include support for conditional permissions (e.g., resource ownership constraints)
5. Document the schema with examples and usage patterns
6. Create a draft structure that follows the least privilege principle
7. Test the schema with sample role definitions to ensure it meets all requirements
8. Validate that the schema can represent all permissions discovered in the audit

## 2. Implement Core Permission Policy File [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the central permissions.ts file with the defined schema and implement the core role definitions with their associated permissions.
### Details:
1. Create the `policies/permissions.ts` file using the schema designed in subtask 1
2. Implement the base permission structure with TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. Define constants for all action types (e.g., 'user:create', 'client:view')
4. Group permissions logically by feature area as determined in the schema design
5. Implement the core roles (Admin, Developer) with their complete permission sets
6. Add JSDoc comments to document the purpose and usage of each permission group
7. Create utility functions for permission checking if needed
8. Write unit tests to verify the structure and basic permission checks
9. Ensure the implementation follows the centralized policy management best practice

## 3. Complete Role-Based Permission Mappings [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Extend the permission policy file to include all roles (Manager, Auditor, Staff, Client) with their specific permission sets and implement conditional permissions where required.
### Details:
1. Add the remaining roles (Manager, Auditor, Staff, Client) to the permissions.ts file
2. Map each role to their allowed actions based on the audit findings
3. Implement conditional permissions using parameterized rules (e.g., resource ownership constraints)
4. Ensure each role follows the least privilege principle
5. Group related permissions logically by feature area for better maintainability
6. Validate that all permissions discovered in the audit are represented
7. Add detailed comments explaining the rationale behind permission assignments
8. Create comprehensive tests for each role to verify correct permission mappings
9. Implement edge cases and special conditions identified during the audit

## 4. Create Permission Utilities and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop utility functions for permission checking, create comprehensive documentation, and implement integration tests to ensure the permission system works as expected.
### Details:
1. Create helper functions for common permission checks (e.g., hasPermission, canAccess)
2. Implement utility methods for role-based permission validation
3. Write comprehensive documentation explaining the permission structure, roles, and usage patterns
4. Create a permissions cheat sheet for developers showing which roles can access which features
5. Implement integration tests that verify permissions work correctly in real application scenarios
6. Add examples of how to use the permission system in different contexts (API routes, UI components)
7. Document the process for updating permissions when new features are added
8. Create visualization of permission hierarchies for easier understanding
9. Ensure all code is properly typed with TypeScript for better developer experience
10. Validate that the implementation follows all best practices identified in the research
