# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Notification Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a notification service that handles message templating, notification creation, and implements smart notification logic.
# Details:
Create src/server/services/notificationService.ts with functions for different notification types: createClientAssignment, createAuditAssignment, and createAuditUpdate. Implement message template generation with React-compatible formatting using the NotificationMessage type structure. Add logic for self-notification prevention (skip if creator = recipient), deduplication (check for identical notifications within time window), entity validation, and rate limiting. Include helper functions for user lookup and message formatting. Implement the message formatting system using React component composition instead of HTML tags.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each notification creation function. Test edge cases like self-notifications, duplicate notifications, and rate limiting. Mock database interactions for isolated testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create NotificationMessage type structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core data structure for notification messages that supports React-compatible formatting
### Details:
Create a TypeScript interface for NotificationMessage that includes fields for message content, formatting options, metadata, and React component composition. The structure should support different notification types (client assignment, audit assignment, audit update) and include properties for sender, recipient, timestamp, priority level, and notification status. Ensure the type structure is extensible for future notification types.

## 2. Implement message templating system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop a flexible templating system that generates React-compatible notification content
### Details:
Create helper functions for message formatting that use React component composition instead of HTML tags. Implement template generators for different notification types that populate the NotificationMessage structure. Include support for dynamic content insertion, conditional formatting based on notification type, and internationalization capabilities. Design the system to be extensible for future template additions.

## 3. Create user lookup and entity validation functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement utility functions for user identification and entity validation
### Details:
Develop helper functions to look up user information needed for notifications. Create validation functions to verify that entities referenced in notifications (clients, audits, assignments) exist and are valid. Implement error handling for cases where entities cannot be found or are invalid. These functions will be used by the notification creation functions to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Implement core notification creation functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create the primary notification generation functions for different notification types
### Details:
Implement the three main notification functions: createClientAssignment, createAuditAssignment, and createAuditUpdate. Each function should accept appropriate parameters, validate inputs, generate the notification message using the templating system, and return a properly formatted NotificationMessage object. Include proper error handling and logging for each function.

## 5. Develop self-notification prevention and deduplication logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Implement logic to prevent unnecessary notifications
### Details:
Add logic to skip notification creation when the creator is the same as the recipient (self-notification prevention). Implement deduplication logic that checks for identical notifications within a configurable time window. Create a mechanism to compare notification content and metadata to identify duplicates. This should include a caching strategy or database query approach to efficiently check recent notifications.

## 6. Implement rate limiting functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Create a rate limiting system to prevent notification flooding
### Details:
Develop a rate limiting mechanism that restricts the number of notifications sent to a user within a specific time period. Implement configurable thresholds for different notification types and priorities. Create a storage solution to track notification counts and timestamps. Add logic to queue or delay notifications that exceed rate limits, ensuring important notifications are still delivered appropriately.

## 7. Integrate and test the complete notification service [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Combine all components into a cohesive service and create comprehensive tests
### Details:
Create the main notificationService.ts file that exports all notification functions and utilities. Implement proper error handling, logging, and performance monitoring. Write unit tests for each component of the service, including template generation, notification creation, deduplication, and rate limiting. Create integration tests that verify the complete notification workflow. Document the API and usage patterns for the notification service.
