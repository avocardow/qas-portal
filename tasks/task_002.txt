# Task ID: 2
# Title: Audit Existing Permission Usage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Scan the codebase to inventory all current permission checks, hooks, and components to ensure complete migration coverage.
# Details:
1. Run `grep -R "usePermission\(" src/` to find all hook usages
2. Run `grep -R "enforcePermission" src/` to find all middleware usages
3. Run `grep -R "RequirePermission" src/` to find all component usages
4. Search for imports of permission constants like `AUDIT_PERMISSIONS` and `TASK_PERMISSIONS`
5. Document all findings in a spreadsheet with columns: file path, line number, permission type, permission value
6. Categorize permissions by functional area (client management, audit, tasks, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
Validate completeness by cross-referencing with application routes and features. Ensure no permission checks are missed by reviewing key protected areas of the application.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Document Permission Hook Usages [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Search the codebase for all instances of permission-related hooks and document their usage.
### Details:
Run `grep -R "usePermission(" src/` to locate all usages of the permission hook. For each result, record the file path, line number, and relevant permission value in a spreadsheet. This ensures that all hook-based permission checks are inventoried for migration coverage.

## 2. Identify and Document Permission Middleware Usages [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Locate all middleware functions enforcing permissions and document their occurrences.
### Details:
Run `grep -R "enforcePermission" src/` to find all middleware-based permission checks. For each occurrence, log the file path, line number, and permission value in the same spreadsheet. This step ensures middleware permission checks are included in the audit.

## 3. Identify and Document Permission Component Usages [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Search for all permission-enforcing components and document their usage.
### Details:
Run `grep -R "RequirePermission" src/` to find all component-based permission checks. Record each instance with file path, line number, and permission value in the spreadsheet. This captures all UI-level permission enforcement.

## 4. Audit Permission Constant Imports [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Search for and document all imports of permission constants throughout the codebase.
### Details:
Search for imports of permission constants such as `AUDIT_PERMISSIONS` and `TASK_PERMISSIONS` using `grep` or IDE search. Document each import's file path and line number, and note the specific constants used. This step ensures all permission references are captured, even if not directly enforced by hooks or components.

## 5. Consolidate and Structure Permission Audit Data [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Aggregate all findings into a structured spreadsheet for analysis and migration planning.
### Details:
Combine all documented permission usages into a single spreadsheet with columns: file path, line number, permission type (hook, middleware, component, constant), and permission value. Ensure consistency and completeness of the data for further analysis.

## 6. Categorize Permissions by Functional Area [done]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Analyze and categorize each permission usage by its functional area to support migration coverage.
### Details:
Review each documented permission usage and assign it to a functional area such as client management, audit, or tasks. Add a 'functional area' column to the spreadsheet and populate it accordingly. This categorization will help ensure migration completeness and facilitate targeted testing.
