# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement UI Polish and Theme Switcher
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Refine the overall user interface based on Phase 1 feedback and implement a theme switcher for light/dark mode with persistence.
# Details:
1. Review Phase 1 feedback and identify UI improvement areas
2. Refine table layouts, form flows, and navigation components
3. Ensure consistent use of Shadcn UI and TailAdmin components throughout the application
4. Improve responsive design for all pages
5. Implement Theme Switcher component with Light/Dark mode options
6. Add theme persistence using localStorage or cookies
7. Create consistent dark mode styles for all components

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify UI improvements address Phase 1 feedback
2. Test responsive design across different devices and screen sizes
3. Confirm theme switcher correctly toggles between light and dark modes
4. Validate theme persistence across page refreshes and sessions
5. Check for any styling inconsistencies or accessibility issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Phase 1 Feedback and Define UI Improvements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all feedback collected from Phase 1 to identify specific areas of the UI that require refinement, such as usability issues, visual inconsistencies, or missing features.
### Details:
Gather feedback documents, user reports, and design notes. Create a prioritized list of actionable UI improvements, focusing on table layouts, form flows, and navigation components. Document these requirements for implementation in subsequent subtasks.

## 2. Refactor and Standardize UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Update and refine table layouts, form flows, and navigation components based on the prioritized feedback, ensuring consistent use of Shadcn UI and TailAdmin components throughout the application.
### Details:
Audit existing UI components for consistency. Refactor or replace components as needed to align with design guidelines and ensure a cohesive look and feel. Leverage reusable components and maintain modular code structure for scalability and maintainability[3].

## 3. Enhance Responsive Design and Cross-Browser Compatibility [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Improve the responsive design of all pages and ensure cross-browser compatibility to provide a seamless experience across devices and browsers.
### Details:
Test UI on various screen sizes and browsers. Adjust CSS and layout logic to resolve any issues. Use feature detection tools and polyfills where necessary to address browser-specific quirks[2][3]. Validate that all components adapt gracefully to different environments.

## 4. Implement Theme Switcher Component with Persistence [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Develop a theme switcher component that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, and persist their preference using localStorage or cookies.
### Details:
Create a UI control for theme switching. Integrate logic to apply the selected theme across the application. Store the user's preference in localStorage or cookies and ensure the theme is restored on subsequent visits.

## 5. Apply and Test Consistent Dark Mode Styles [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Ensure all UI components have consistent and visually appealing dark mode styles, and thoroughly test the theme switcher functionality across the application.
### Details:
Audit all components for dark mode compatibility. Update styles as needed to maintain readability and aesthetic quality. Test the theme switcher across different pages, devices, and browsers to ensure reliable persistence and visual consistency.

# Implementation Plan

1. **Define CSS Variables & Utility Classes**
   - In `src/app/(pages)/globals.css`, create semantic color variables:
   ```css
   :root {
     --color-primary: #1a1a1a;
     --color-surface: #ffffff;
     --color-surface-accent: #f3f4f6;
     --color-border: #e5e7eb;
     --color-text-primary: #111827;
     --color-text-secondary: #4b5563;
   }
   
   .dark {
     --color-primary: #f3f4f6;
     --color-surface: #121212;
     --color-surface-accent: #1e1e1e;
     --color-border: #2e2e2e;
     --color-text-primary: #f9fafb;
     --color-text-secondary: #9ca3af;
   }
   ```

2. **Component Refactoring Strategy**
   - Replace hardcoded color values with CSS variables or Tailwind classes
   - Example conversion:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 text-gray-900">
   
   // After
   <div className="bg-surface border border-border text-primary">
   ```
   - Create custom Tailwind utility classes in `tailwind.config.js`:
   ```js
   theme: {
     extend: {
       colors: {
         surface: 'var(--color-surface)',
         border: 'var(--color-border)',
         primary: 'var(--color-text-primary)',
         // etc.
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Testing Methodology**
   - Create a test matrix covering all major components in both themes
   - Test focus states, hover effects, and transitions between themes
   - Verify contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards using browser dev tools
   - Test theme persistence across page navigation and browser refresh

4. **Theme Toggle Implementation**
   - Use localStorage to persist theme preference
   - Add immediate visual feedback during theme switch with subtle transition

5. **Documentation**
   - Document theming architecture and extension patterns
   - Include screenshots of key components in both themes
