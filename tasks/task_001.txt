# Task ID: 1
# Title: Database Schema Migration for Notifications
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the database schema changes to enhance the notifications table with new columns and constraints as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Execute SQL migrations to add the following to the notifications table: 'type' column (VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL), 'entityId' column (VARCHAR(255)), 'createdByUserId' column (VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL). Add foreign key constraints to users table. Create indexes for performance optimization (idx_notifications_user_unread, idx_notifications_user_created, idx_notifications_type_entity, idx_notifications_created_by). Add enum constraint for notification types to ensure valid values ('client_assignment', 'audit_assignment', 'audit_stage_update', 'audit_status_update'). Test the migration with rollback capability.

# Test Strategy:
Verify schema changes using database inspection tools. Test foreign key constraints with sample data. Validate indexes with EXPLAIN queries. Ensure constraint enforcement by attempting invalid insertions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document current schema and create migration plan [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the existing notifications table schema and create a detailed migration plan with goals, risks, and rollback strategy
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation of the current notifications table structure. Define the migration objectives aligned with business goals. Document the planned changes including new columns ('type', 'entityId', 'createdByUserId'), foreign key constraints, and indexes. Identify potential risks and create a detailed rollback strategy. Use version control to track all documentation and migration scripts. Include validation steps to ensure data integrity throughout the migration process.

## 2. Create migration scripts with rollback capability [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop SQL migration scripts that add the new columns and constraints with proper rollback functionality
### Details:
Write SQL migration scripts to add the new columns: 'type' (VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL), 'entityId' (VARCHAR(255)), and 'createdByUserId' (VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL) to the notifications table. Create corresponding rollback scripts that can revert these changes. Implement the enum constraint for notification types ('client_assignment', 'audit_assignment', 'audit_stage_update', 'audit_status_update'). Ensure scripts are idempotent and can be safely run multiple times. Store all scripts in version control with clear naming conventions that indicate execution order.

## 3. Implement foreign key constraints and indexes [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Add foreign key constraints and create the specified indexes for performance optimization
### Details:
Create SQL scripts to add foreign key constraints linking the 'createdByUserId' column to the users table. Implement the four required indexes: idx_notifications_user_unread (for filtering unread notifications by user), idx_notifications_user_created (for sorting notifications by creation date), idx_notifications_type_entity (for filtering by notification type and entity), and idx_notifications_created_by (for filtering by creator). Include rollback scripts that drop these constraints and indexes. Test the constraint behavior to ensure it properly enforces referential integrity.

## 4. Set up automated testing environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create an isolated testing environment and automated tests to validate the migration
### Details:
Set up a dedicated testing environment that mirrors the production database. Create automated tests that verify: successful column addition, constraint enforcement, index creation and performance, and rollback functionality. Implement data validation tests to ensure existing data remains intact. Create tests for the enum constraint to verify it properly restricts values. Develop performance tests to confirm the new indexes improve query performance as expected. Document all test cases and expected results.

## 5. Execute migration in staging environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Deploy the migration to staging, perform validation tests, and verify application compatibility
### Details:
Execute the migration scripts in the staging environment following the dual-write pattern: first deploy code that can handle both old and new schema, then migrate the schema while maintaining backward compatibility. Verify that the application correctly interacts with the new schema. Run performance tests to ensure the new indexes improve query efficiency. Validate that the enum constraint properly restricts notification types. Test the rollback procedure to confirm it works as expected. Document any issues encountered and their resolutions.

## 6. Deploy to production and monitor [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Execute the migration in production with monitoring and post-deployment verification
### Details:
Schedule the production migration during a low-traffic period. Implement monitoring to track database performance during and after migration. Execute the migration scripts with careful validation at each step. Verify that all new columns, constraints, and indexes are created correctly. Monitor application performance and database query execution times. Have the rollback plan ready for immediate execution if issues arise. After successful deployment, document the completed migration, including any deviations from the original plan. Remove any temporary dual-write code after confirming stability.
