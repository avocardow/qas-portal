# Task ID: 1
# Title: Evaluate and Select Permission Library
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Compare CASL and AccessControl libraries based on feature parity, ESM support, bundle size, and community support to select the most appropriate library for our permission engine.
# Details:
1. Use Context7 to review documentation for both CASL and AccessControl via `mcp_context7_get-library-docs`
2. Create a comparison matrix with criteria: action/subject model support, dynamic conditions, ESM compatibility, bundle size, community activity
3. Build small proof-of-concept implementations with both libraries
4. Test performance with a representative set of permission rules
5. Document findings and make a final selection with justification
6. Install the selected library with `npm install` or `yarn add`

# Test Strategy:
Create a test harness that validates the library against our key use cases: role-based permissions, conditional permissions, and performance with large rule sets. Document the results.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Comparison Matrix and Documentation Analysis [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze documentation for both CASL and AccessControl libraries to create a comprehensive comparison matrix based on key criteria including feature support, ESM compatibility, bundle size, and community activity.
### Details:
1. Use Context7 to retrieve and review complete documentation for both libraries via `mcp_context7_get-library-docs`
2. Create a structured comparison matrix with the following criteria:
   - Action/subject model support and flexibility
   - Dynamic conditions and field-level permission capabilities
   - ESM module compatibility and import syntax
   - Bundle size analysis (use tools like Bundlephobia)
   - Community activity metrics (GitHub stars, issues, PRs, last commit)
   - TypeScript support quality
   - Integration options with React and other frameworks
3. Document the permission models of each library (CASL's Ability model vs AccessControl's RBAC approach)
4. Analyze documentation quality and learning curve
5. Test for: Ability to handle complex permission scenarios with nested resources
6. Create a summary document with initial findings

Testing approach: Verify documentation completeness and accuracy by cross-referencing with GitHub repositories and community discussions.

## 2. Develop Proof-of-Concept Implementations [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Build small proof-of-concept implementations with both CASL and AccessControl libraries to evaluate their practical usage, API ergonomics, and implementation patterns.
### Details:
1. Create a simple test project with both libraries installed
2. For CASL implementation:
   - Define an ability configuration using the AbilityBuilder pattern
   - Implement permission checks for CRUD operations on a sample resource
   - Test field-level permissions using CASL's subject field filtering
   - Implement conditional permissions based on user attributes
   - Test integration with React components using @casl/react

3. For AccessControl implementation:
   - Define a grants object with role-based permissions
   - Implement permission checks for CRUD operations
   - Test ownership-based permissions using the 'own' vs 'any' concepts
   - Implement attribute-based filtering if supported

4. Document code patterns and implementation differences
5. Evaluate TypeScript type safety and developer experience

Testing approach: Create unit tests for each implementation to verify correct permission enforcement across various scenarios including: basic CRUD permissions, conditional permissions, field-level access control, and role inheritance.

## 3. Performance and Bundle Size Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Conduct comprehensive performance testing and bundle size analysis for both libraries with representative permission rule sets to evaluate runtime efficiency and impact on application size.
### Details:
1. Create a standardized test suite with the following components:
   - A representative set of 50-100 permission rules of varying complexity
   - Test cases for common permission check patterns
   - Benchmarking code to measure execution time

2. Measure and compare performance metrics:
   - Initialization time for permission configuration
   - Execution time for simple permission checks
   - Execution time for complex conditional checks
   - Memory usage patterns

3. Analyze bundle size impact:
   - Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to visualize bundle composition
   - Measure tree-shaking effectiveness with different import patterns
   - Test ESM vs CommonJS bundle size differences
   - Evaluate impact when using partial imports

4. Test scalability with large permission sets
5. Document performance findings with quantitative metrics

Testing approach: Use Jest for performance testing with realistic permission scenarios. Create multiple test runs to ensure statistical significance. Document both average and worst-case performance characteristics.

## 4. Final Selection and Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Based on the comprehensive analysis and testing, make a final library selection, document the justification, and integrate the chosen library into the project.
### Details:
1. Create a final decision matrix that weighs all evaluation criteria:
   - Feature completeness for project requirements
   - Performance characteristics with realistic workloads
   - Bundle size impact and optimization potential
   - Developer experience and API ergonomics
   - Community support and maintenance outlook
   - Integration capabilities with existing architecture

2. Document the final selection with clear justification:
   - Summarize key advantages of the selected library
   - Address potential limitations and mitigation strategies
   - Include performance and bundle size metrics from testing

3. Create an integration plan:
   - Install the selected library with proper version pinning
   - Create a centralized permission configuration module
   - Document standard patterns for permission checks
   - Provide examples for UI integration (React components, etc.)

4. Implement a simple permission service that encapsulates the library's API
5. Create documentation for other developers on how to use the permission system

Testing approach: Create integration tests that verify the permission system works correctly with the application's authentication system and properly enforces permissions across different user roles and scenarios.
