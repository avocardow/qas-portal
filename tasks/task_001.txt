# Task ID: 1
# Title: Integrate DataTableTwo UI Component
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the current Table markup with DataTableTwo component in the Clients List page
# Details:
1. Import DataTableTwo from src/components/tables/DataTables/TableTwo/DataTableTwo.tsx
2. Remove existing Table component and markup
3. Configure DataTableTwo with basic props (data, columns)
4. Ensure responsive layout is maintained
5. Remove row-level delete icon from current implementation
6. Setup pagination using DataTableTwo's built-in functionality
7. Implement sorting indicators as per DataTableTwo documentation

# Test Strategy:
Verify the table renders correctly with sample data. Check responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Ensure pagination controls work as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Import DataTableTwo Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Import the DataTableTwo component into the Clients List page to prepare for integration.
### Details:
Add the following import statement at the top of the Clients List page file: `import DataTableTwo from 'src/components/tables/DataTables/TableTwo/DataTableTwo'`. Ensure the path is correct and the component is available.

<info added on 2025-04-25T05:12:04.575Z>
To implement this import effectively:

1. Locate the Clients List page file (likely in `src/pages/Clients` or similar directory)

2. Add the import statement after existing table-related imports for better code organization:
   ```javascript
   // Existing imports
   import Table from 'src/components/tables/Table';
   // Add the new import here
   import DataTableTwo from 'src/components/tables/DataTables/TableTwo/DataTableTwo';
   ```

3. Verify the component exists by checking the import path in your IDE or running a quick build to catch any path errors

4. Consider adding a comment above the import explaining the transition plan:
   ```javascript
   // DataTableTwo will replace the current Table implementation in subsequent tasks
   import DataTableTwo from 'src/components/tables/DataTables/TableTwo/DataTableTwo';
   ```

5. If using TypeScript, you may need to import any associated types:
   ```javascript
   import DataTableTwo, { DataTableTwoProps } from 'src/components/tables/DataTables/TableTwo/DataTableTwo';
   ```

## 2. Remove Existing Table Markup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Eliminate the current Table component and all related markup from the Clients List page.
### Details:
Identify and delete the existing Table component, including its JSX, props, and any related logic or helper functions that are no longer needed.

<info added on 2025-04-25T05:14:11.276Z>
To remove the existing Table markup, follow these steps:

1. Locate the Clients List page component (likely in `src/pages/clients` or similar directory)

2. Remove these specific elements:
   - The `<Table>` component import statement
   - All related imports like `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, and `TableCell`
   - Any table-specific props or configurations

3. Delete the following code sections:
   - The entire table rendering block (typically wrapped in a `<Table>` component)
   - Any column definition arrays or objects
   - Table-specific event handlers (sort, filter, pagination related to the old table)
   - Helper functions that format or transform data specifically for the old table

4. Add a temporary placeholder:
   ```jsx
   {/* DataTableTwo component will be implemented here */}
   <div className="placeholder-for-datatable">
     <p>New DataTable coming soon</p>
   </div>
   ```

5. Check for and remove any table-specific CSS classes or styles in related stylesheets

6. Ensure any data fetching or state management remains intact for later use with the new DataTableTwo component

## 3. Configure DataTableTwo with Data and Columns [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up DataTableTwo with the required data and columns configuration to display the clients list.
### Details:
Prepare the data and columns objects according to DataTableTwo's API. Pass them as props to DataTableTwo. Ensure column definitions match the previous table's structure and requirements.

## 4. Ensure Responsive Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Verify and adjust the layout to maintain responsiveness after integrating DataTableTwo.
### Details:
Test the page on various screen sizes. Adjust container classes, DataTableTwo props, or parent layout as needed to ensure the table remains responsive and visually consistent with the rest of the UI.

## 5. Remove Row-Level Delete Icon [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Remove the row-level delete icon from the new DataTableTwo implementation.
### Details:
Ensure that the columns configuration for DataTableTwo does not include a delete icon or delete action. If present, remove the relevant column or cell renderer.

## 6. Set Up Pagination Using DataTableTwo [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Enable and configure pagination using DataTableTwo's built-in pagination functionality.
### Details:
Consult DataTableTwo documentation to enable pagination. Pass the necessary pagination props (such as page size, current page, and handlers) to the component. Test to confirm pagination works as expected.

## 7. Implement Sorting Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Add sorting indicators to columns as specified in the DataTableTwo documentation.
### Details:
Update the columns configuration to enable sorting. Ensure sorting indicators are visible and functional, following DataTableTwo's recommended approach for sortable columns.
