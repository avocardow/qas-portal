# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Client Profile Page Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic page structure for the client profile at the specified path with routing and layout components.
# Details:
Create the page file at `src/app/(pages)/(dashboard)/(app)/clients/[clientId]/page.tsx`. Set up the TailAdmin grid layout using `xl:grid-cols-12` for responsive design. Include `PageBreadcrumb` component at the top. Implement the basic page structure with placeholder sections for all the required components (KPI cards, tables, charts, etc.). Follow Cursor rules for code styling and component usage.

# Test Strategy:
Verify page renders without errors. Test responsive breakpoints to ensure layout collapses properly on mobile. Check that routing with dynamic [clientId] parameter works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic client profile page file with routing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the initial page file at the specified path with proper Next.js routing configuration
### Details:
Create the file at `src/app/(pages)/(dashboard)/(app)/clients/[clientId]/page.tsx`. Implement the basic React component structure with proper TypeScript typing for the dynamic route parameter. Set up the page component to receive and validate the clientId parameter from the URL. Include proper export default statement and implement basic error handling for invalid client IDs.

## 2. Implement responsive TailAdmin grid layout [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the responsive grid layout structure using TailAdmin components
### Details:
Implement the TailAdmin grid layout using `xl:grid-cols-12` for responsive design. Create the main container div with appropriate TailAdmin classes. Set up responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes (sm, md, lg, xl). Ensure the layout follows the Cursor code styling rules. Add appropriate padding, margins, and gap settings for the grid layout.

## 3. Add PageBreadcrumb component [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Integrate the PageBreadcrumb component at the top of the page
### Details:
Import the `PageBreadcrumb` component from the shared components library. Configure the breadcrumb with the correct navigation path (Dashboard > Clients > Client Profile). Ensure the client name is dynamically displayed in the breadcrumb when available. Style the breadcrumb according to the design system with proper spacing above and below the component.

## 4. Create placeholder sections for KPI cards [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up the structure for KPI cards section with appropriate grid positioning
### Details:
Create a section for KPI cards with appropriate grid column spans. Implement placeholder components for each KPI card with loading states. Position the KPI cards in the top section of the page. Use TailAdmin card components with proper styling. Include placeholder titles, values, and icons for each KPI card.

## 5. Implement placeholder sections for tables [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create the structure for data tables with proper grid positioning
### Details:
Set up placeholder table components in the appropriate grid positions. Create table headers with placeholder column names. Implement skeleton loading states for table rows. Add pagination controls as placeholders. Ensure tables are responsive and maintain proper styling on different screen sizes. Follow TailAdmin table component guidelines.

## 6. Add placeholder sections for charts [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create the structure for chart components with proper grid positioning
### Details:
Implement placeholder chart components in the designated grid areas. Set up chart containers with appropriate dimensions and responsive behavior. Add placeholder titles and legends for each chart. Create skeleton loading states for charts. Ensure chart containers follow the design system's styling guidelines.

## 7. Integrate layout components and finalize page structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
### Description: Connect all placeholder sections and ensure proper layout integration
### Details:
Connect all previously created sections into a cohesive page layout. Ensure proper spacing between all components. Implement any necessary wrapper components for consistent styling. Add appropriate error boundaries around each section. Test the responsive behavior across all breakpoints. Verify that the layout follows the Cursor rules for code styling and component usage. Add comments for future implementation of actual data fetching and component functionality.
