# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Page Scaffolding
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the client profile page file with basic structure, breadcrumbs, and TailAdmin grid layout.
# Details:
Create `src/app/(pages)/(dashboard)/(app)/clients/[clientId]/page.tsx` with the following:
1. Import necessary components from TailAdmin
2. Setup page layout with responsive grid using TailAdmin components
3. Implement PageBreadcrumb component with Home > Clients > [Client Name] structure
4. Add sidebar navigation link to this page
5. Create placeholder sections for all required components (Client Overview, Current Audit, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
Verify page renders without errors and breadcrumbs display correctly. Check responsive layout at different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Basic Page Structure with Layout Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the client profile page file with the basic structure, imports, and TailAdmin layout components to establish the foundation for the page.
### Details:
1. Create the file `src/app/(pages)/(dashboard)/(app)/clients/[clientId]/page.tsx`
2. Import necessary components from TailAdmin such as Breadcrumb, Card, and Grid components
3. Create a functional component that uses Next.js dynamic routing to access the clientId parameter
4. Implement a responsive container using TailAdmin's layout system with appropriate padding and margin
5. Add basic error handling for invalid client IDs
6. Set up the page title and metadata using Next.js head components
7. Test the basic page rendering with different viewport sizes to ensure responsive behavior
8. Ensure the page follows the application's established design patterns and styling conventions

## 2. Implement Breadcrumb Navigation and Sidebar Link [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add the breadcrumb navigation component showing the hierarchical path and update the sidebar navigation to include a link to the client profile page.
### Details:
1. Import the PageBreadcrumb component from TailAdmin
2. Configure the breadcrumb with the Home > Clients > [Client Name] structure
3. Implement dynamic client name fetching for the breadcrumb based on the clientId parameter
4. Add proper linking to each breadcrumb segment (Home and Clients list)
5. Update the sidebar navigation configuration to include a link to the clients section
6. Ensure the sidebar highlights the current page when on the client profile
7. Test breadcrumb navigation to verify all links work correctly
8. Implement proper accessibility attributes for the breadcrumb navigation (aria-current, etc.)
9. Add hover states and visual indicators for interactive breadcrumb elements

## 3. Create Content Section Placeholders with Grid Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Implement the responsive grid layout for the client profile page and add placeholder sections for all required components that will be developed in future tasks.
### Details:
1. Use TailAdmin's grid system to create a responsive layout with appropriate breakpoints
2. Implement a two-column layout for desktop that collapses to a single column on mobile
3. Create placeholder Card components for each section: Client Overview, Current Audit, Client History, etc.
4. Add appropriate headings and skeleton UI elements in each placeholder section
5. Implement proper spacing between sections using TailAdmin's spacing utilities
6. Add comments in the code indicating where future components will be integrated
7. Ensure the grid layout maintains proper alignment and spacing across all viewport sizes
8. Test the layout with various screen sizes to verify responsive behavior
9. Add subtle visual indicators (like borders or background colors) to distinguish different sections
10. Implement container queries if needed for more complex responsive behaviors within sections
