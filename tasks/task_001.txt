# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Client Profile Page Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic page structure for the Client Profile at src/app/(pages)/(dashboard)/(app)/clients/[clientId]/page.tsx with TailAdmin grid layout and PageBreadcrumb.
# Details:
Create the page.tsx file with proper Next.js App Router structure. Implement a responsive TailAdmin grid layout (xl:grid-cols-12) with appropriate breakpoints. Add PageBreadcrumb component at the top. Setup the basic sections that will contain all the client information cards and components. Follow Cursor rules for code styling and component usage.

# Test Strategy:
Verify page renders without errors. Check responsive layout at different breakpoints. Ensure grid layout matches TailAdmin specifications.
