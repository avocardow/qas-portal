# Task ID: 1
# Title: Inventory Existing RBAC Usage
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive inventory of all useRbac(), canAccess(), and rbacPolicy usages throughout the codebase to plan the migration strategy.
# Details:
Use grep or similar tools to search the codebase for all instances of 'useRbac', 'canAccess', 'rbacPolicy', and other related terms. Create a spreadsheet or document listing each file, the specific usage pattern, and the permission strings being checked. Group findings by component type (buttons, pages, etc.) and complexity. Document any custom logic that might need special handling during migration.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the inventory by cross-checking with Context7 and manual code review to ensure no usage patterns are missed. The inventory should include file paths, line numbers, and the specific permission checks being performed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up automated code scanning tools [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and set up code scanning tools to automatically identify RBAC-related patterns across the codebase
### Details:
Install and configure grep, ripgrep, or specialized code analysis tools to search for RBAC-related patterns. Create search patterns for 'useRbac()', 'canAccess()', 'rbacPolicy', and other authorization-related functions. Set up the tools to output results in a structured format (JSON or CSV) that can be easily imported into analysis tools. Include file paths, line numbers, and surrounding context in the output format. Test the scanning setup on a small subset of the codebase to verify accuracy.

## 2. Execute comprehensive codebase scan [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Run the configured scanning tools across the entire codebase to identify all instances of RBAC usage
### Details:
Execute the scanning tools across all repositories and branches that contain production code. Include both frontend and backend code in the scan. Ensure the scan covers all programming languages used in the project (JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.). Run additional targeted searches for indirect RBAC implementations that might use different naming conventions. Collect all scan results into a centralized location for analysis. Document any scanning errors or inaccessible code areas.

## 3. Create structured inventory database [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Develop a structured database or spreadsheet to catalog and categorize all RBAC usage findings
### Details:
Create a spreadsheet or database with columns for: file path, line number, function/method name, RBAC pattern type (useRbac, canAccess, etc.), permission strings being checked, component type (button, page, API endpoint, etc.), and additional notes. Import the scan results into this structure, cleaning and normalizing the data as needed. Add metadata fields for tracking migration status later. Create unique identifiers for each RBAC usage instance to reference during migration.

## 4. Analyze and categorize RBAC patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Review the inventory to identify common patterns, group similar implementations, and categorize by complexity
### Details:
Analyze the collected data to identify common RBAC implementation patterns. Group similar implementations together based on their structure and purpose. Categorize each instance by complexity (simple permission check, complex conditional logic, custom implementations, etc.). Identify any deprecated or inconsistent RBAC implementations. Tag components that handle sensitive operations or data for special attention. Create a summary of pattern categories with counts and examples.

## 5. Document custom RBAC logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Identify and document any custom or complex RBAC logic that requires special handling during migration
### Details:
Review each complex RBAC implementation identified in the previous step. Document the business logic and security requirements behind each custom implementation. Create flowcharts or decision trees for complex permission checks. Interview relevant developers or product owners to understand the rationale behind custom implementations. Identify any hardcoded roles or permissions that should be configurable. Document edge cases and special conditions that trigger specific access controls.

## 6. Map component dependencies and interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Analyze how RBAC-protected components interact with each other and identify dependency chains
### Details:
Map the relationships between components that use RBAC checks. Identify parent-child relationships where permissions cascade. Document cases where multiple RBAC checks protect the same resource through different paths. Create visualization diagrams of complex permission structures. Identify potential security gaps where RBAC implementations might be inconsistent across related components. Document API endpoints and their corresponding frontend components that should have matching RBAC implementations.

## 7. Generate comprehensive migration planning report [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5, 1.6
### Description: Create a detailed report with migration recommendations based on the inventory analysis
### Details:
Compile all findings into a comprehensive report document. Include statistics on RBAC usage patterns and their distribution across the codebase. Prioritize components for migration based on security importance, complexity, and dependencies. Recommend standardized approaches for different types of RBAC implementations. Identify potential risks and challenges for the migration process. Create a phased migration plan with estimated effort for each component group. Include recommendations for testing and validation procedures during migration.
