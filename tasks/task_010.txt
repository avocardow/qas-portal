# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Pagination for Notification Lists [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an efficient pagination system for notification lists to improve frontend performance and reduce server load when handling large volumes of notifications.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Add cursor-based pagination to notification API endpoints using limit and cursor parameters
2. Implement database query optimization with LIMIT and OFFSET clauses
3. Create indexed queries to support efficient pagination
4. Add infinite scroll functionality in the frontend using IntersectionObserver API
5. Implement skeleton loading states for paginated content
6. Cache paginated results using Redis with appropriate TTL
7. Add proper HTTP headers for cache control

Testing approach:
- Unit test pagination logic with various page sizes
- Measure and compare load times before and after implementation
- Test with large datasets (10,000+ notifications)
- Verify memory usage remains stable during scrolling

## 2. Implement WebSocket Connection Pooling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up connection pooling for WebSockets to efficiently manage connections, reduce server resource consumption, and improve scalability for the notification system.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure a connection pool manager using a library like ws or Socket.IO
2. Implement connection reuse patterns to avoid creating new connections unnecessarily
3. Set appropriate pool size limits based on expected concurrent users
4. Add connection timeout and idle connection cleanup mechanisms
5. Implement health checks for connections in the pool
6. Add metrics collection for connection pool usage
7. Configure graceful shutdown procedures for the connection pool

Testing approach:
- Measure connection establishment time before and after pooling
- Test with simulated concurrent connections (1000+)
- Monitor server resource usage under load
- Verify connections are properly recycled and not leaking

## 3. Implement Exponential Backoff for Reconnection [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a robust reconnection strategy with exponential backoff to handle network interruptions gracefully and prevent overwhelming the server with reconnection attempts.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a backoff algorithm with configurable initial delay, maximum delay, and jitter
2. Implement client-side reconnection logic that increases wait time between attempts
3. Add randomized jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
4. Create a connection state machine (disconnected, connecting, connected)
5. Implement event handlers for connection failures and successful reconnections
6. Add user feedback during reconnection attempts
7. Set maximum retry limits and fallback to polling if needed

Testing approach:
- Simulate network interruptions to verify reconnection behavior
- Test with various network conditions (high latency, packet loss)
- Verify backoff intervals increase correctly
- Ensure the system recovers and synchronizes state after reconnection

## 4. Set Up Monitoring for Notification Service [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the notification system to track performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and ensure reliable operation.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection with custom metrics for notification delivery rates, queue lengths, and latency
2. Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization of key performance indicators
3. Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry to track notification flow across services
4. Configure alerting thresholds for critical metrics (queue backlog, error rates, latency spikes)
5. Add logging with structured format and appropriate log levels
6. Implement health check endpoints for service status monitoring
7. Create a notification delivery status tracking system

Testing approach:
- Verify metrics are correctly collected under various load conditions
- Test alert triggering with simulated failure scenarios
- Validate dashboard accuracy with known workloads
- Ensure tracing captures the complete notification lifecycle

## 5. Optimize Database Queries with Proper Indexing [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Analyze and optimize database queries related to notifications, implementing appropriate indexes to improve query performance and reduce database load.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Analyze query patterns using database profiling tools to identify slow queries
2. Create compound indexes for frequently used query patterns (user_id + created_at, status + priority)
3. Implement database query caching using Redis for frequently accessed notification data
4. Optimize JOIN operations and consider denormalization where appropriate
5. Implement database connection pooling to manage concurrent connections efficiently
6. Add query timeout handling to prevent long-running queries
7. Consider partitioning strategies for the notifications table if volume is very high

Testing approach:
- Benchmark query performance before and after optimization
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to verify index usage
- Test with production-scale data volumes
- Monitor database load during peak notification periods

## 6. Conduct Load Testing and Implement UI Improvements [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive load testing of the notification system and implement accessibility and responsive design improvements for better user experience across devices.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up load testing environment using k6 or JMeter to simulate high notification volumes
2. Create test scenarios for various load patterns (steady, spike, gradual increase)
3. Implement accessibility improvements including ARIA attributes for notification elements
4. Add screen reader announcements for new notifications using aria-live regions
5. Enhance responsive design with specific breakpoints for mobile notification viewing
6. Optimize notification rendering for touch interfaces
7. Implement performance budgets for notification UI components

Testing approach:
- Run load tests with gradually increasing concurrent users (up to 10,000)
- Measure system behavior under sustained high load
- Test accessibility with screen readers and automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse)
- Verify responsive design across various device sizes and orientations

## 7. Create Comprehensive Test Suite for Notification Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Develop a complete test suite covering all notification scenarios, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure system reliability.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create unit tests for core notification logic (formatting, prioritization, routing)
2. Implement integration tests for notification delivery across different channels
3. Develop end-to-end tests for complete notification workflows
4. Set up test fixtures and factories for generating test notification data
5. Implement property-based testing for edge cases and boundary conditions
6. Create visual regression tests for notification UI components
7. Set up continuous integration pipeline to run tests automatically

Testing approach:
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%) for critical notification components
- Include tests for error handling and edge cases
- Test notification delivery across all supported channels
- Verify correct behavior for various notification types and priorities
- Test notification preferences and user-specific settings
