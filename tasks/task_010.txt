# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Comprehensive RBAC and Final Integration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure consistent RBAC across all components and integrate all features
# Details:
1) Review and ensure consistent RBAC implementation across all backend procedures, throwing TRPCError('FORBIDDEN') for unauthorized access. 2) Implement frontend RBAC using useSession to conditionally render/disable UI elements based on user roles. 3) Perform final integration of all components, ensuring seamless navigation and data flow between Client, Audit, and Task management features. 4) Conduct end-to-end testing of complete workflows. 5) Optimize performance with proper loading states and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of all workflows from different user role perspectives. Verify all acceptance criteria are met. Test edge cases and error scenarios. Conduct performance testing with realistic data volumes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define RBAC Role Structure and Permission Model [done]

3. Document role inheritance hierarchies if applicable
4. Create a centralized policy definition file (in YAML or JSON) following the policy-as-code approach
5. Test the model with example user scenarios to validate completeness
6. Ensure the model follows the principle of least privilege
7. Testing approach: Create unit tests that validate role definitions and permission mappings

6. Create test helpers for RBAC unit testing
7. Testing approach: Write unit tests for middleware with different role scenarios

## 3. Apply RBAC to All Backend Procedures [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Systematically review and apply RBAC checks to all existing backend procedures to ensure consistent access control.
### Details:
1. Create an inventory of all tRPC procedures requiring RBAC
2. Group procedures by required permission level
3. Apply the RBAC middleware to each procedure with appropriate permission checks
4. Ensure proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
5. Verify that all data access is properly restricted based on user roles
6. Document any exceptions or special cases
7. Testing approach: Create integration tests that verify each procedure enforces proper access control

## 4. Implement Frontend RBAC Context Provider [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a React context provider that makes user role and permission information available throughout the frontend application.
### Details:
1. Create a RBACProvider component that wraps the application
2. Integrate with useSession to extract user role information
3. Implement helper hooks (useRole, usePermission, canAccess) for checking permissions
4. Add caching for permission checks to improve performance
5. Ensure the context updates when session changes
6. Add development tools for debugging RBAC issues
7. Testing approach: Write unit tests for the context provider and hooks

## 5. Apply RBAC to Frontend Components and Routes [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Implement conditional rendering and route protection across all frontend components based on user roles.
### Details:
1. Create protected route components that redirect unauthorized users
2. Implement conditional rendering for navigation items based on permissions
3. Add permission checks to all action buttons and interactive elements
4. Implement graceful UI handling for unauthorized states
5. Ensure forms and inputs respect write permissions
6. Add visual indicators for read-only or restricted content
7. Testing approach: Create component tests with different user role mocks

## 6. Integrate Client Management with RBAC [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5
### Description: Ensure Client Management features properly integrate with the RBAC system for both data access and UI permissions.
### Details:
1. Review all client data access points and apply appropriate RBAC checks
2. Update client listing to only show clients the user has permission to view
3. Modify client detail views to respect read/write permissions
4. Implement role-specific client management workflows
5. Ensure client-related actions (create, update, delete) check for proper permissions
6. Add permission-aware filtering and sorting options
7. Testing approach: End-to-end tests for client management workflows with different user roles

## 7. Integrate Audit Features with RBAC [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5
### Description: Apply RBAC to all audit-related features, ensuring proper access control for sensitive audit information.
### Details:
1. Review all audit data access points and apply appropriate RBAC checks
2. Implement role-specific audit log views and filters
3. Ensure audit trail information is only accessible to authorized roles
4. Add permission checks for audit report generation
5. Implement audit configuration settings with role-based access
6. Create specialized audit views for compliance officers
7. Testing approach: Integration tests for audit feature access with different user roles

## 8. Integrate Task Management with RBAC [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5
### Description: Apply RBAC to task management features, ensuring tasks are only visible and editable by authorized users.
### Details:
1. Review all task data access points and apply appropriate RBAC checks
2. Implement task assignment rules based on user roles
3. Modify task listings to only show tasks the user has permission to view
