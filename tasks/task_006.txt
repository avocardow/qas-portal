# Task ID: 6
# Title: Configure CI environment for Supabase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up environment variables and configuration for the CI environment to connect to the Development Supabase instance.
# Details:
Create or update configuration files for CI:
- Add Supabase connection environment variables to `.env.example` and CI configuration
- Document the required environment variables in README or documentation
- Create a CI workflow step to validate database connection
- Ensure secrets are properly managed and not exposed in logs

Follow project-specific Cursor rules for environment configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Run a CI test job that connects to the Development Supabase instance and performs a simple query. Verify environment variables are correctly loaded and the connection succeeds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Document Required Supabase Environment Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: List all environment variables needed for the CI environment to connect to the Development Supabase instance. Document their purpose and required values in the project README or documentation.
### Details:
Review Supabase documentation and your project's requirements to determine which variables (e.g., SUPABASE_API_URL, SUPABASE_API_KEY, PROJECT_ID) are necessary. Add a section to the README or a dedicated documentation file explaining each variable, its purpose, and any security considerations.[1][2]

## 2. Update .env.example and CI Configuration Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Add the identified Supabase environment variables to the .env.example file and ensure the CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) references these variables appropriately.
### Details:
Edit the .env.example file to include placeholders for all required Supabase variables. Update the CI workflow configuration to reference these variables, using the CI platform's secret management features (e.g., GitHub Actions secrets). Ensure the variables are not hardcoded and are sourced securely.[1]

## 3. Configure Secret Management in CI Platform [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Set up secure storage of Supabase credentials in the CI platform's secret management system to prevent accidental exposure.
### Details:
Add Supabase credentials (such as API keys and project URLs) to the CI platform's secrets or environment variables section. Reference these secrets in the CI configuration, ensuring they are not printed or logged during workflow execution.[1]

## 4. Implement CI Workflow Step to Validate Supabase Database Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Add a step in the CI workflow that attempts to connect to the Development Supabase instance using the configured environment variables, and fails the workflow if the connection is unsuccessful.
### Details:
Use the Supabase CLI or a custom script in the CI workflow to attempt a database connection. For example, run a simple Supabase CLI command that requires authentication, and check for success or failure. Ensure that any output does not leak secrets.[1][4]

## 5. Review and Enforce Security and Logging Best Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Audit the CI configuration and workflow to ensure that secrets are not exposed in logs and that environment variables are handled according to project-specific Cursor rules.
### Details:
Review the CI workflow for any steps that might inadvertently print secrets or sensitive information. Use the CI platform's features to mask secrets in logs. Confirm that all environment configuration follows Cursor rules and update documentation as needed to reflect security practices.[1]
