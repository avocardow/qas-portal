# Task ID: 6
# Title: Testing and Documentation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing across the application and document the migration for future reference.
# Details:
Create a test plan covering all major pages and features with different user roles. Smoke-test each page to verify permissions are enforced correctly. Add unit and integration tests specifically for useAbility checks. Create a changeset documenting the RBAC overhaul following Cursor Rules. Update any developer documentation to reflect the new permission system. Verify that the Developer role bypass works as expected but doesn't affect other roles.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the test plan with multiple user roles. Verify each permission-gated feature works correctly. Use automated tests where possible. Document any edge cases or special considerations for future reference. Have another developer review the changes and test independently.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Comprehensive Test Plan [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a structured test plan covering all major application pages and features across different user roles
### Details:
Create a matrix-style test plan document that maps each application page/feature against all user roles. Include test scenarios for both positive testing (users with correct permissions) and negative testing (users without permissions). Define expected outcomes for each test case. Prioritize critical paths and high-risk areas. Include environment setup requirements and test data needed. The test plan should specifically address permission boundaries between roles and edge cases where permissions might overlap.

## Test Implementation Details

### Unit Test Implementation
- Configure Jest mocks for AbilityContext to simulate different permission scenarios
- Create test fixtures with predefined role/permission combinations
- Implement snapshot testing for permission-dependent UI components
- Test coverage target: >90% for permission-related hooks and components

### Integration Test Strategy
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept API calls and simulate server responses
- Create test data factories to generate consistent test fixtures
- Implement user session simulation with different role contexts
- Test matrix should include cross-browser verification (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### E2E Testing Specifics
- Implement custom Cypress commands for role-based authentication
- Create reusable test patterns for common permission-gated workflows
- Record videos of permission boundary tests for documentation
- Test data reset between test runs to ensure isolation

### Performance Testing
- Measure render time differences with/without permission checks
- Verify caching mechanisms for permission data
- Test permission resolution under high load (many rules/roles)

### Regression Test Automation
- Automate permission boundary tests to run on PR creation
- Implement visual regression tests for permission-dependent UI elements
- Create CI pipeline stage specifically for RBAC testing

### Test Reporting
- Generate permission coverage reports showing tested/untested permission combinations
- Include permission test results in CI/CD dashboard
- Document any permission edge cases discovered during testing

## 2. Implement Unit and Integration Tests for useAbility [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop automated tests specifically for the useAbility permission check functionality
### Details:
Create unit tests for the useAbility hook/function that verify it correctly evaluates permissions for different user roles. Test with mock user contexts representing each role in the system. Implement integration tests that verify useAbility works correctly when integrated with actual components. Include tests for edge cases such as undefined permissions, role changes, and permission inheritance. Use Jest for unit tests and consider Cypress or React Testing Library for integration tests. Ensure tests verify that the Developer role bypass works as expected without affecting other roles.

## 3. Perform Smoke Testing Across Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Execute smoke tests on all application pages to verify correct permission enforcement
### Details:
Following the test plan from subtask 1, manually navigate through each page of the application with different user role accounts. Verify that permissions are enforced correctly - users can only access and perform actions they're authorized for. Document any discrepancies between expected and actual behavior. Pay special attention to areas where permissions might cascade or inherit. Test the Developer role bypass functionality to ensure it works as expected but doesn't affect other roles. Create a checklist of all pages tested and their pass/fail status.

## 4. Create RBAC Migration Changeset Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Document the RBAC implementation changes following Cursor Rules
### Details:
Create a comprehensive changeset document that follows the Cursor Rules format. Include all components modified, new components created, and permission structures implemented. Document the permission model architecture, including how roles are defined and how permissions are checked. Include code examples showing the before and after implementation of permission checks. Document any database or API changes related to permissions. Create diagrams showing the permission flow and inheritance. This documentation should serve as both a record of changes and a guide for understanding the new system.

## 5. Update Developer Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Revise existing developer documentation to reflect the new permission system
### Details:
Review all existing developer documentation and update it to reflect the new RBAC system. Create new documentation sections specifically for the permission system, including how to use the useAbility hook, how to define new permissions, and best practices for permission checks. Include examples of correct implementation patterns. Update any API documentation to include permission requirements for each endpoint. Create a troubleshooting guide for common permission-related issues. Ensure documentation includes information about the Developer role bypass functionality and when it should be used.

## 6. Conduct Final Verification and Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Perform final verification of the RBAC implementation and regression testing
### Details:
Conduct a final verification pass to ensure all aspects of the RBAC system are working correctly. Verify that all documentation accurately reflects the implemented system. Perform regression testing to ensure the RBAC changes haven't negatively impacted existing functionality. Test critical user journeys end-to-end with different user roles. Verify edge cases such as role changes, permission inheritance, and the Developer role bypass. Document any issues found and create a final report summarizing the testing results, including test coverage metrics, issues found and resolved, and any remaining concerns or recommendations.
