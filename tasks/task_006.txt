# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Contact Network Diagram
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement a simple graph visualization on the Client Profile page showing relationships between client, contacts, and trust accounts.
# Details:
Create a simple network diagram showing the relationships: client → contacts → trust accounts. Use an appropriate visualization library compatible with TailAdmin. Keep the diagram simple and focused on key relationships. Ensure the diagram is responsive and degrades gracefully on smaller screens.

# Test Strategy:
Test diagram rendering with different relationship structures. Verify visual clarity and readability. Check responsiveness and fallback on mobile devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and select visualization library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and select an appropriate graph visualization library compatible with TailAdmin, Next.js, and React
### Details:
Research visualization libraries like D3.js, React Flow, Vis.js, or Cytoscape.js that work well with TailAdmin's React/Next.js environment. Compare features including performance, responsiveness, customization options, and documentation quality. Consider libraries that support directed graphs to show relationships between clients, contacts, and trust accounts. Test basic integration with TailAdmin to ensure compatibility. Document the selected library with justification and basic implementation examples.

## 2. Define data structure for network relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a standardized data structure to represent client, contact, and trust account relationships
### Details:
Design a JSON data structure that represents nodes (clients, contacts, trust accounts) and edges (relationships between them). Define node types with appropriate properties (e.g., id, name, type, status). Create edge definitions with source, target, and relationship type. Ensure the data structure is compatible with the selected visualization library. Include sample data that demonstrates various relationship scenarios. Document the schema with examples for development reference.

## 3. Implement basic network diagram component [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create a React component that renders the basic network diagram using the selected library
### Details:
Create a new React component in the TailAdmin framework that implements the visualization library. Set up the component to accept the data structure defined in subtask 2. Implement basic node and edge rendering with default styling. Add container sizing and basic layout algorithms. Ensure the component handles empty or minimal data gracefully. Test the component with sample data to verify basic functionality. Document component props and usage examples.

## 4. Add styling and visual enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Enhance the network diagram with appropriate styling, colors, and visual elements
### Details:
Apply TailAdmin's design system to the network diagram for visual consistency. Create distinct visual styles for different node types (clients, contacts, trust accounts) using appropriate colors, shapes, and icons. Style relationship edges to indicate relationship types. Add tooltips or hover effects to display additional information. Implement visual indicators for active/inactive relationships. Ensure all styling uses Tailwind CSS classes where possible for consistency with TailAdmin. Document styling options and customization capabilities.

## 5. Implement responsive behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Ensure the network diagram is responsive and degrades gracefully on smaller screens
### Details:
Implement responsive sizing for the diagram container based on viewport dimensions. Add media queries or Tailwind responsive classes to adjust diagram properties on different screen sizes. Create simplified view modes for mobile devices (possibly collapsing certain nodes or showing alternative representations). Test responsive behavior across various device sizes. Implement touch interactions for mobile users. Add zoom/pan controls that work well on both desktop and mobile. Document responsive behavior and breakpoints.

## 6. Add interactive features and integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Implement user interactions and integrate the diagram with the broader application
### Details:
Add click/tap interactions to select nodes and view detailed information. Implement filtering capabilities to focus on specific relationship types or entities. Create methods for programmatically highlighting specific relationships. Add animation for state changes (e.g., when filtering or selecting). Integrate the component with TailAdmin's state management approach. Ensure the component exposes appropriate events and callbacks for parent components. Create documentation for all interactive features and integration points. Perform final testing with realistic data volumes and user scenarios.
