# Task ID: 6
# Title: Testing and Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the enhanced Clients List page
# Details:
1. Write unit tests for query logic and data transformations
2. Test role-based access control for Admin vs Manager/Client views
3. Perform accessibility audit on the table and controls
4. Test performance with large datasets
5. Verify all features work across supported browsers
6. Check that all Cursor rules are followed
7. Validate that the implementation meets all requirements in the PRD
8. Test edge cases like empty search results, no clients, etc.

# Test Strategy:
Run automated tests for query logic. Manually test with different user roles. Use accessibility tools to verify ARIA compliance. Load test with large datasets to ensure performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop and Execute Unit Tests for Query Logic and Data Transformations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write and run unit tests to validate the correctness of all query logic and data transformation functions used in the Clients List page.
### Details:
Use a framework such as dbt or your project's preferred testing tool to create unit tests with mock data. Ensure tests cover expected outputs, edge cases, and error handling for all SQL or data transformation logic. Review test results and update logic as needed to address any failures.[1][3][4]

## 2. Test Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for All User Types [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Verify that Admin, Manager, and Client users see only the data and controls appropriate to their roles, and that unauthorized access is prevented.
### Details:
Simulate each user role and test all relevant UI elements and API endpoints. Attempt to access restricted features as lower-privilege users to confirm proper enforcement of RBAC policies. Document any discrepancies and update access rules as needed.

## 3. Perform Accessibility Audit of Table and Controls [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Assess the Clients List page for compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1), focusing on the table, filters, buttons, and navigation.
### Details:
Use automated tools (such as axe or Lighthouse) and manual testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers) to identify accessibility issues. Address problems such as missing ARIA labels, insufficient contrast, or non-semantic markup.

## 4. Test Performance with Large Datasets [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Evaluate the Clients List page's responsiveness and stability when handling large volumes of client data.
### Details:
Seed the database or mock API with a large number of client records. Measure page load times, scrolling performance, and interaction latency. Identify and optimize any bottlenecks in data fetching, rendering, or pagination.

## 5. Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility and Cursor Rule Compliance [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Ensure that all features of the Clients List page function correctly across all supported browsers and that cursor usage follows design guidelines.
### Details:
Test the page in each supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on relevant platforms. Check that all interactive elements use the correct cursor styles (pointer, default, etc.) as specified in the UI guidelines.

## 6. Validate PRD Requirements and Edge Case Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Confirm that the implementation meets all requirements in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and robustly handles edge cases.
### Details:
Cross-check the Clients List page against the PRD checklist. Test scenarios such as empty search results, no clients in the system, and invalid input. Document results and address any gaps or failures before sign-off.
