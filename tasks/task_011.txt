# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the compliance checklist and alerts/warnings for missing or expired documentation.
# Details:
Create a Regulatory Checklist component showing compliance items ('Trust deed', 'Bank statements', etc.) with check marks. Implement Alerts & Warnings section flagging missing or expired documentation and upcoming license renewals. Use appropriate visual indicators for different alert severities.

# Test Strategy:

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Regulatory Checklist Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core checklist component displaying compliance items with status indicators
### Details:
Develop a reusable checklist component that displays regulatory compliance items (such as 'Trust deed', 'Bank statements', etc.) with appropriate status indicators. The component should include: 1) A list view of all compliance items, 2) Visual check marks or status icons for each item, 3) The ability to categorize items by type or importance, 4) Timestamps showing when items were last updated or verified, and 5) A responsive design that works across different screen sizes. Use a data structure that stores item name, status, expiration date, and category for each compliance item.

## 2. Develop Alert/Warning Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create the logic to identify missing, expired, or soon-to-expire documentation
### Details:
Build the backend logic that analyzes compliance items to detect issues requiring alerts. This system should: 1) Check for completely missing documentation, 2) Identify expired documents by comparing current date with expiration dates, 3) Flag upcoming expirations within a configurable time window (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days), 4) Assign severity levels to different types of alerts (critical for expired, warning for upcoming, etc.), 5) Create a data model that captures alert type, severity, affected item, and recommended action, and 6) Implement scheduled checks that run automatically to keep alerts current.

## 3. Create Alerts & Warnings Display Section [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement the visual representation of alerts with appropriate severity indicators
### Details:
Develop the UI component that displays the alerts and warnings generated by the detection system. This should include: 1) A dedicated 'Alerts & Warnings' section in the interface, 2) Visual indicators for different severity levels (e.g., red for critical, yellow for warnings, blue for informational), 3) Grouping of alerts by type or affected documentation, 4) Clear messaging explaining the issue and recommended action, 5) Interactive elements allowing users to acknowledge alerts or mark them as 'in progress', and 6) Filtering capabilities to focus on specific types of alerts or severity levels. Ensure the component updates in real-time when new alerts are generated or existing ones are resolved.
