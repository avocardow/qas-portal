# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Permission Refresh Mechanism
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system to update user permissions in real-time when role assignments change.
# Details:
1. Implement a WebSocket or polling mechanism to detect permission changes
2. Update the PermissionProvider to refresh permissions when notified
3. Ensure UI components re-render appropriately when permissions change
4. Add a manual refresh option for fallback
5. Implement debouncing to prevent excessive updates
6. Add error handling for failed permission refreshes
7. Include logging for debugging permission update issues

# Test Strategy:
Create tests that simulate permission changes and verify that the UI updates accordingly. Test both automatic and manual refresh mechanisms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Permission Change Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mechanism to detect when user permissions or role assignments change in the system
### Details:
Implement a WebSocket connection for real-time updates or a polling mechanism that checks for permission changes at regular intervals. Include configuration options for refresh frequency and connection management. The detection system should compare permission timestamps or version numbers to identify changes. Implement debouncing logic to prevent excessive updates when multiple permission changes occur in rapid succession. Add appropriate error handling for connection failures and recovery mechanisms.

## 2. Update PermissionProvider Service [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Enhance the existing PermissionProvider to handle permission refresh events
### Details:
Modify the PermissionProvider service to subscribe to the permission change detection system. Implement methods to refresh the permission cache when notified of changes. Create a permission refresh workflow that fetches updated permissions from the authorization server using refresh tokens. Add support for both automatic refreshes triggered by the detection system and manual refreshes initiated by users. Implement proper error handling for failed permission refreshes, including retry logic and fallback mechanisms. Ensure the provider maintains a consistent state even during refresh operations.

## 3. Implement UI Component Refresh Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Ensure UI components re-render appropriately when permissions change
### Details:
Create a permission context or observable that UI components can subscribe to for permission updates. Implement a notification system that triggers UI component re-renders when permissions change. Ensure that permission-dependent UI elements (like buttons, menu items, or form fields) update their visibility or enabled state based on the latest permissions. Add transition effects for smooth UI updates when permissions change. Test various UI components under different permission change scenarios to ensure consistent behavior.

## 4. Add Logging and Manual Refresh Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive logging and user-facing controls for permission refreshes
### Details:
Create a logging system that records all permission refresh events, including successful updates, failures, and retry attempts. Implement a user-facing manual refresh button or option in appropriate locations (user profile, settings page, or system header). Add visual indicators to show when permissions are being refreshed. Create an admin dashboard component to monitor permission refresh status across the system. Implement notification mechanisms to alert users when their permissions have changed significantly. Add detailed error messages and troubleshooting guidance for failed permission refreshes.
