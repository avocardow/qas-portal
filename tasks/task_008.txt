# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Browser Push Notifications
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Add browser notification support for users not actively viewing the application.
# Details:
Create a browser notification service that handles permission requests and notification creation. Implement context-aware permission request that triggers only when the first notification is about to be sent. Create structured browser notifications with title, body, icon, and action buttons as specified in the PRD. Implement click handling for browser notifications to navigate to the appropriate page. Add permission state management and graceful fallback to in-app only if permissions are denied. Use the Notification API with the specified BrowserNotification interface structure. Handle notification click events to open the appropriate page and mark as read.

# Test Strategy:
Test permission request flow with different browser settings. Verify notification display with various message types. Test click handling and navigation. Verify graceful fallback when permissions are denied. Test across different browsers for compatibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Browser Notification Interface and Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the BrowserNotification interface structure and create a notification service module to encapsulate all browser notification logic.
### Details:
Specify the BrowserNotification interface with fields for title, body, icon, and action buttons as per the PRD. Implement a notification service class or module that exposes methods for requesting permission, creating notifications, and handling notification events. Ensure the service is modular and reusable.

## 2. Implement Permission Request and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Handle browser notification permission requests and manage the user's permission state within the application.
### Details:
Add logic to request notification permissions only when the first notification is about to be sent (context-aware). Store and track the permission state (granted, denied, default) in the service. Ensure that permission requests are not shown unnecessarily and that the UI reflects the current permission state.

## 3. Create Structured Notification Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement the logic to generate and display browser notifications using the Notification API, following the structured format defined in the interface.
### Details:
Use the Notification API to create notifications with the specified title, body, icon, and action buttons. Ensure the notification payload is validated and structured according to the interface. Integrate with the service worker if required for background notifications[3].

## 4. Implement Notification Click Handling and Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Handle click events on browser notifications to navigate users to the appropriate page and mark notifications as read.
### Details:
Add event listeners for notification click events, either in the main app or in the service worker for background notifications[3]. Implement logic to open the relevant page (using window focus or navigation) and update the notification state to 'read' in the application.

## 5. Add Graceful Fallback to In-App Notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement fallback logic to display in-app notifications if browser notification permissions are denied or unavailable.
### Details:
Check the permission state before attempting to send a browser notification. If permissions are denied or unsupported, trigger the existing in-app notification system instead, ensuring users are always notified regardless of browser capabilities.

## 6. Test and Validate Notification Flows Across Browsers [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Thoroughly test browser notification flows, permission handling, click actions, and fallback mechanisms on all supported browsers and platforms.
### Details:
Verify that notifications are displayed correctly with all specified fields, permission requests are context-aware, click actions work as intended, and fallback to in-app notifications occurs when necessary. Address any browser-specific quirks or limitations discovered during testing.
