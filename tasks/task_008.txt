# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create documentation and verification guide
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Document the implemented features, folder structure, and provide a verification guide for the development team.
# Details:
Create documentation that includes:
- Overview of the implemented folder structure and routing
- Guide to running the migration script with example commands
- Instructions for verifying data in Supabase Table Editor
- List of placeholder pages and their intended future functionality
- Next steps for Phase 1 development

Place documentation in the project wiki or README.md file following project conventions.

# Test Strategy:
Have a team member follow the documentation to navigate the application and run the migration script. Collect feedback on clarity and completeness. Verify all commands and paths in the documentation are accurate.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Folder Structure and Routing Overview [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a section that explains the project's folder structure and routing logic, referencing how files and folders map to application routes.
### Details:
Analyze the current project directory. Describe how the folder and file organization defines the application's routing, referencing conventions such as file-based routing (e.g., Next.js or Expo Router). Include a visual or tabular representation if helpful. Ensure this overview is clear for new developers to understand how navigation is structured.[1][2][5]

## 2. Write Migration Script Usage Guide [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Provide step-by-step instructions for running the migration script, including example commands and expected outputs.
### Details:
Identify the migration script(s) used in the project. Document prerequisites, command-line usage, environment variables, and sample commands. Clarify where to find the script, how to execute it, and how to interpret success or error messages. Ensure instructions are platform-agnostic or specify OS-specific steps as needed.

## 3. Create Data Verification Instructions for Supabase Table Editor [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Detail the process for verifying migrated data using the Supabase Table Editor, including navigation steps and data validation tips.
### Details:
Outline how to access the Supabase Table Editor, locate relevant tables, and check that data has been correctly migrated. Include screenshots or example queries if appropriate. Highlight common issues and troubleshooting steps for data verification.

## 4. List Placeholder Pages and Intended Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Compile a list of all current placeholder pages in the application and describe their planned future functionality.
### Details:
Review the routing and page structure to identify all placeholder or stub pages. For each, provide a brief description of its intended purpose and any relevant notes on future development. Organize this information in a clear, accessible format.

## 5. Summarize Next Steps for Phase 1 Development and Finalize Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Outline the next development steps for Phase 1 and ensure all documentation is compiled and formatted according to project conventions.
### Details:
Work with the team to identify and summarize the immediate next steps for Phase 1. Review all documentation sections for clarity and completeness. Place the final documentation in the project wiki or README.md, following established formatting and organizational standards.
