# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive integration testing of all implemented features, fix any issues, and make final adjustments to ensure the portal functions as a cohesive hub for internal team operations.
# Details:
1. Create end-to-end test scenarios covering all implemented features
2. Test interactions between different components (e.g., initiating calls from client detail page)
3. Verify all acceptance criteria from the PRD are met
4. Optimize performance for data-heavy pages
5. Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback throughout the application
6. Address any remaining UI/UX issues
7. Update documentation for new features
8. Perform final cross-browser and device testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute end-to-end test scenarios for all user roles
2. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
3. Test cross-feature interactions
4. Perform load testing with realistic data volumes
5. Conduct usability testing with representative users
6. Validate cross-browser compatibility
7. Check accessibility compliance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop and Execute Comprehensive Integration Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement integration test cases that cover all interactions between modules and features, ensuring that combined components function as intended.
### Details:
Identify all major workflows and user journeys across the portal. Create integration test scripts that simulate real-world usage, focusing on interactions between modules (e.g., initiating calls from client detail pages). Use automated testing tools where possible to execute these scenarios and document any failures or unexpected behaviors.

## 2. Verify Acceptance Criteria and Address Functional Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Systematically check that all acceptance criteria from the Product Requirements Document (PRD) are met, and resolve any functional defects uncovered during integration testing.
### Details:
Cross-reference test results with the PRD to ensure every feature and requirement is validated. Log and prioritize any issues found, then implement fixes and retest affected areas to confirm resolution. Collaborate with stakeholders to clarify ambiguous criteria if needed.

## 3. Optimize Performance and Ensure Consistent Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Improve the performance of data-heavy pages and standardize error handling and user feedback mechanisms throughout the application.
### Details:
Profile the application to identify slow-loading or resource-intensive pages. Apply optimizations such as query improvements, caching, or UI enhancements. Review error handling across all modules to ensure consistent messaging and user experience, updating code and UI as necessary.

## 4. Finalize UI/UX, Documentation, and Cross-Platform Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Polish the user interface and experience, update documentation for new features, and conduct final cross-browser and device compatibility testing.
### Details:
Address any remaining UI/UX issues for visual consistency and usability. Update user and technical documentation to reflect the latest features and changes. Perform thorough testing across supported browsers and devices, resolving any compatibility issues before release.
