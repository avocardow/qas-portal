# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Document Reference Display Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create Document tabs/sections for Client, Audit, and Task detail pages
# Details:
Add Documents tabs/sections to Client, Audit, and Task detail pages. Each should display a list of document references with fileName and 'Open' links to sharepointFileUrl. Use the appropriate document.getBy* procedure based on the context. Style consistently with Tailwind and Shadcn UI / TailAdmin components.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test document list display on each detail page. Verify links open correctly to SharePoint URLs. Test with various user roles to confirm proper visibility based on RBAC.
