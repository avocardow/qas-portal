# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Multi-device Read Status Synchronization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Ensure notification read status is synchronized across multiple devices for the same user.
# Details:
Enhance the markAsRead and markAllAsRead mutations to broadcast read status changes to all connected clients. Update the frontend subscription handler to process read status updates from other sessions. Implement optimistic UI updates for read status changes to improve perceived performance. Add logic to handle conflicts when multiple devices attempt to mark the same notification as read. Ensure the unread count badge updates in real-time across all devices when a notification is read on any device.

# Test Strategy:
Test with multiple browser sessions for the same user. Verify read status synchronizes across sessions. Test conflict resolution with simultaneous read operations. Measure performance impact of synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enhance Backend Mutations to Broadcast Read Status Changes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the markAsRead and markAllAsRead backend mutations to broadcast notification read status updates to all active sessions/devices for the user.
### Details:
Update the backend logic so that when a notification is marked as read (individually or in bulk), a real-time event (e.g., via WebSocket, GraphQL subscription, or push notification) is emitted to all connected clients for the user. Ensure the event payload includes notification IDs and the new read status. This lays the foundation for cross-device synchronization[1][2][4].

## 2. Update Frontend Subscription Handler for Real-Time Read Status [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement or update the frontend logic to listen for read status updates from the backend and update the UI accordingly.
### Details:
On the frontend, subscribe to the backend's real-time read status events. When an event is received, update the notification list and unread count badge to reflect the new read status. Ensure the UI updates seamlessly, even if the change originated from another device[2][4].

## 3. Implement Optimistic UI Updates for Read Actions [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Provide immediate UI feedback when a user marks a notification as read, before receiving backend confirmation.
### Details:
When the user marks a notification as read, immediately update the UI to reflect the change (optimistic update). If the backend later reports a failure or conflict, revert the UI change and notify the user as appropriate. This improves perceived performance and responsiveness.

## 4. Add Conflict Resolution Logic for Simultaneous Read Actions [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Handle cases where multiple devices attempt to mark the same notification as read at the same time, ensuring consistency.
### Details:
Implement backend logic to detect and resolve conflicts when concurrent read actions occur. Use event identifiers or timestamps to determine the correct state, ensuring all devices converge on the same read status[1]. Optionally, notify clients of any conflict resolution outcomes.

## 5. Synchronize and Update Unread Count Badge in Real-Time [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Ensure the unread count badge updates instantly across all devices when a notification is read on any device.
### Details:
Tie the unread count badge to the real-time subscription handler so it updates immediately upon receiving read status events. Test across multiple devices to confirm that the badge remains accurate and consistent, regardless of where the action originated.
