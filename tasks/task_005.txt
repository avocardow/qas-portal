# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Authorized Component
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a reusable component that conditionally renders children based on permission checks.
# Details:
1. Create `src/components/Authorized.tsx`
2. Implement a component that uses the `useAbility` hook
3. Accept props: `action`, `subject`, `fallback` (optional component to show when unauthorized)
4. Conditionally render children based on permission check
5. Add TypeScript prop types
6. Optimize to prevent unnecessary re-renders
7. Document usage examples for the component

# Test Strategy:
Write component tests that verify rendering behavior with different permission scenarios. Test with and without fallback components, and verify that updates to permissions correctly affect rendering.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Authorized Component File [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new file named `Authorized.tsx` in the `src/components` directory.
### Details:
This file will serve as the base for the reusable authorized component. Ensure it is correctly placed within your project structure.

## 2. Implement useAbility Hook Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Integrate the `useAbility` hook into the `Authorized` component to handle permission checks.
### Details:
Use the `useAbility` hook to fetch or determine the user's abilities. This hook should be part of a library like CASL or a custom implementation.

## 3. Define Component Props and Types [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Define the props for the `Authorized` component, including `action`, `subject`, and an optional `fallback` component.
### Details:
Use TypeScript to define the types for these props, ensuring clarity and type safety. The `action` and `subject` props will be used for permission checks, while `fallback` will be displayed if the user lacks permission.

## 4. Implement Conditional Rendering Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Conditionally render the children of the `Authorized` component based on the permission check using the `useAbility` hook.
### Details:
Use the `useAbility` hook to check if the user has the required permission. If they do, render the children; otherwise, render the `fallback` component if provided.

## 5. Optimize for Performance [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Optimize the component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
### Details:
Use React hooks like `useMemo` or `useCallback` to memoize functions or values that don't change frequently. This ensures that the component only re-renders when necessary.

## 6. Document Usage Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Create documentation for the `Authorized` component, including usage examples.
### Details:
Document how to use the component, including how to pass props and how it handles different scenarios (e.g., authorized vs. unauthorized users). Include code snippets to illustrate its usage.

## 7. Test and Validate Component Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Write tests to validate the functionality of the `Authorized` component.
### Details:
Use a testing framework like Jest or Cypress to write unit tests and integration tests. Ensure the component behaves correctly in various scenarios, such as when the user is authorized or unauthorized.
