# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Contacts Table and Network Diagram
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the contacts table and relationship network diagram.
# Details:
Build the Recent Contacts Table using TailAdmin's DataTableTwo component with columns for Name (linked to /contacts/[id]), Email, Phone, Title, and Primary badge. Display multiple licenses per contact cleanly. Implement the Contact Network Diagram showing relationships between client, contacts, and trust accounts. Reference DataTableTwo APIDocs from Context7 for implementation details.

# Test Strategy:
Test table sorting and filtering. Verify links to contact profiles work correctly. Test network diagram with various relationship configurations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up DataTableTwo component structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure the DataTableTwo component from TailAdmin for the Recent Contacts Table implementation
### Details:
Create a new component file for the Contacts Table. Import the DataTableTwo component from TailAdmin. Set up the basic table structure with appropriate props and configuration options. Define the table container with responsive styling using Tailwind CSS classes. Reference the TailAdmin documentation for proper component initialization and configuration options.

## 2. Define contact data schema and column configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the data schema and column configuration for the Contacts Table with all required fields
### Details:
Define the data schema for contacts with fields for Name, Email, Phone, Title, and Primary badge status. Configure columns with appropriate headers, cell renderers, and sorting options. Implement the Name column with links to individual contact pages using the '/contacts/[id]' route pattern. Set up proper data types and validation for each field. Create sample data for testing the table implementation.

## 3. Implement multiple licenses display functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a component to cleanly display multiple licenses per contact within the table
### Details:
Design and implement a custom cell renderer component for displaying multiple licenses. Use Tailwind CSS for styling license badges or tags with appropriate colors and spacing. Implement collapsible/expandable functionality if the number of licenses exceeds a certain threshold. Ensure the display is responsive and maintains table layout integrity. Test with contacts having varying numbers of licenses.

## 4. Create data fetching and state management logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement the data fetching and state management for the Contacts Table
### Details:
Set up data fetching logic using React hooks or a state management library. Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering functionality. Create loading and error states for the table. Implement search functionality for the contacts table. Set up proper state updates when data changes. Ensure the table maintains its state during user interactions.

## 5. Design the Contact Network Diagram component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic structure and layout for the Contact Network Diagram
### Details:
Research and select an appropriate visualization library for network diagrams (e.g., D3.js, React Flow, or Vis.js). Create a new component for the Contact Network Diagram. Design the basic layout and container for the diagram. Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes. Set up the component with proper props and configuration options.

## 6. Implement relationship data model and visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Create the data model and visualization for relationships between clients, contacts, and trust accounts
### Details:
Define the data structure for representing relationships between entities (clients, contacts, trust accounts). Implement node rendering for different entity types with distinct visual representations. Create edge rendering for relationships with appropriate styling. Implement interactive features like zooming, panning, and node selection. Add tooltips or information panels to display additional details about entities and relationships.

## 7. Integrate and finalize both components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.6
### Description: Integrate the Contacts Table and Network Diagram components into the main application and finalize implementation
### Details:
Integrate both components into the main application layout. Implement any necessary interactions between the table and diagram (e.g., selecting a contact in the table highlights it in the diagram). Add final styling and UI polish using Tailwind CSS. Perform comprehensive testing across different browsers and screen sizes. Optimize performance for large datasets. Add documentation for component usage and maintenance. Ensure accessibility compliance for both components.
