# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Client Assignment Notifications
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add notification triggers for client assignment changes in client creation and update flows.
# Details:
Modify api.clients.update and api.clients.create mutations to trigger notifications when assignedUserId changes. In EditClientModal.tsx and AddClientModal.tsx, add logic to detect assignment changes and call notificationService.createClientAssignment with appropriate parameters (assignedUserId, clientId, clientName, createdByUserId). Ensure self-notification prevention by comparing assignedUserId with session.user.id. Add error handling to prevent notification failures from affecting the main operation.

# Test Strategy:
Test client creation and updates with different assignment scenarios. Verify notifications are created with correct data. Confirm self-assignments don't create notifications. Test error handling by simulating notification service failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement notificationService.createClientAssignment method [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the notification service method that will handle client assignment notifications with proper parameters and error handling
### Details:
Develop the notificationService.createClientAssignment method that accepts assignedUserId, clientId, clientName, and createdByUserId parameters. This method should create and send a notification when a client is assigned to a user. Implement error handling within this method to catch and log any issues without throwing exceptions that would affect the main client operations. The method should return a success/failure status that can be safely ignored by calling code. Include logic to prevent self-notifications by comparing the assignedUserId with the user creating the assignment.

## 2. Modify api.clients.create mutation to trigger notifications [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Update the client creation API to detect and trigger notifications for initial client assignments
### Details:
Modify the api.clients.create mutation to capture the assignedUserId value during client creation. After successfully creating the client record, call the notificationService.createClientAssignment method with the appropriate parameters (assignedUserId, the newly created clientId, clientName, and the session.user.id as createdByUserId). Wrap the notification call in a try/catch block to ensure that any notification failures don't affect the client creation process. Add a comparison check between assignedUserId and session.user.id to prevent self-notifications when users create clients assigned to themselves.

## 3. Update AddClientModal.tsx with notification logic [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Enhance the client creation modal to support the notification flow when assigning clients
### Details:
Modify the AddClientModal.tsx component to work with the updated api.clients.create mutation. Ensure the component correctly passes the assignedUserId parameter when creating a new client. If the API doesn't automatically trigger notifications, add client-side logic to detect when a client is being created with an assignedUserId and call notificationService.createClientAssignment directly. Implement proper error handling to prevent notification failures from affecting the client creation UI flow. Update any form validation or submission logic as needed to support the new notification requirements.

## 4. Implement notification triggers in api.clients.update and EditClientModal.tsx [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add logic to detect assignment changes during client updates and trigger appropriate notifications
### Details:
Modify the api.clients.update mutation to detect changes in assignedUserId by comparing the new value with the previous value stored in the database. Only trigger notifications when the assignedUserId actually changes. In the EditClientModal.tsx component, implement logic to track the original assignedUserId when the modal opens and compare it with the new value on submission. If changed, call notificationService.createClientAssignment with the new assignedUserId, clientId, clientName, and session.user.id. Add proper error handling in both the API and UI components to ensure notification failures don't disrupt the main client update functionality. Include the self-notification prevention check by comparing the new assignedUserId with session.user.id.
