## Manual Smoke Tests
| Test Area                                | Roles Tested                           | Result                                |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Clients Page Access & Actions           | Admin, Manager, Staff, Client          | ✅ Pass                                 |
| Email Compose & Shared Mailbox           | Admin, Developer, Client               | ✅ Pass                                 |
| Task Management (Create, Update, Delete) | Admin, Manager, Developer, User        | ✅ Pass / ⛔ (User denied as expected)   |
| Document Access by Role                  | Admin, Manager, Client, User           | ✅ Pass / ⛔ (Unauthorized denied)       |
| Audit Operations                         | Admin, Auditor, Staff, Client          | ✅ Pass / ⛔ (Staff denied create)       |
| Phone Page Access                        | Admin, Manager, Client, Staff          | ✅ Pass / ⛔ (Staff denied)              |

## Edge Case Verification
- **Developer bypass**: Verified `useAbility` always returns true for Developer role across all actions.
- **Permission Inheritance**: Confirmed nested permission checks propagate correctly.
- **Role Switch**: Switched user roles at runtime; UI updates immediately reflect new permissions.

## Documentation Verification
- `docs/project-documentation.md`: Updated with Authorization and Permissions section.
- `README.md`: Updated Quick Links for Developer Documentation: Permissions.
- `docs/permissions.md`, `docs/rbac-migration-changeset.md`, `docs/rbac-migration-plan.md`: Reviewed and up-to-date.

## Issues Found & Resolved
| Issue                                      | Status       | Notes                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| None                                       | N/A          | All tests and manual smoke tests passed without discrepancies. |

## Recommendations
- Maintain automated permission tests with every new permission addition.
- Integrate permission test coverage threshold in CI (e.g., >90%).
- Update this report if any new RBAC changes are introduced.
- Consider integrating E2E role-based flows in CI (e.g., via Cypress).
