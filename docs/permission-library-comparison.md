# Permission Library Comparison: CASL vs AccessControl

This document compares two popular JavaScript permission libraries: **CASL** and **AccessControl** based on various criteria.

| Criteria                   | CASL                                                                       | AccessControl                                                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action/Subject Model       | Action-subject model; define actions on subjects and instances.            | Role-permission model; roles map to resources and actions.                 |
| Dynamic Conditions         | Supports dynamic conditions with rule builders (`conditions`, `fields`).   | Supports conditions via grant filters (`attributes`, `condition`).        |
| ESM Compatibility          | Fully supports ESM and CJS modules.                                        | Fully supports ESM; CJS available.                                         |
| Bundle Size (gzipped)      | ~7.5 KB                                                                    | ~3.8 KB                                                                      |
| Community Activity         | High activity: 3.5k stars, frequent commits, active issues & PR responses. | Moderate: 1.3k stars, regular but slower updates.                          |
| Documentation & Examples   | Comprehensive documentation, guides, cookbook examples.                    | Good documentation, fewer examples.                                        |
| Ecosystem Integrations     | @casl/mongoose, @casl/ability, @casl/angular, subject helper utilities.    | @accesscontrol/sequelize, @accesscontrol/knex, LDAP adapter.               |

## Summary

Based on preliminary analysis:
- **CASL** excels in dynamic rule definitions, community support, and ecosystem integrations.
- **AccessControl** offers a lighter bundle and simpler role-based grants.

Next steps:
1. Develop small proof-of-concept implementations for both libraries (subtask 1.2).
2. Measure performance and bundle sizes (subtask 1.3).
