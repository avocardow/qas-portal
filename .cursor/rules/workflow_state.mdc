# Workflow State (STM) - 2025-01-23 02:09:00

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Prisma: 60s | TypeScript: 90s

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** pnpm install, npm test, git push, prisma db push, next build, tsc --noEmit

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMMITTING`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Task ID: 7 - "Implement Audit Progress Update Notifications"
- **Parsed Task Description:** Add notification triggers for audit stage and status changes to notify client managers. Modify api.audit.updateAudit mutation to trigger notifications when audit stage or status changes. In EditAuditModal.tsx, add logic to detect stage/status changes and call notificationService.createAuditUpdate with appropriate parameters (clientManagerId from clients.assignedUserId, auditId, clientName, auditYear, changeType, newValue, createdByUserId).
- **Implementation Priority:** Medium
- **Dependencies:** Tasks 2 & 3 (completed) 
- **Complexity Score:** 6 (moderate)
- **Subtasks:** 5 subtasks covering change detection, notification integration, and error handling
- **Test Strategy:** Test audit updates with different stage/status changes, verify notifications to correct client managers, confirm self-notification prevention, test error handling

## 3. Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis Complete - Infrastructure Assessment
1. **‚úÖ COMPLETE:** `NotificationService.createAuditUpdateNotification` exists and is fully functional
   - Located at `src/server/services/notificationService.ts:548-655`
   - Supports both 'stage' and 'status' change types
   - Includes self-notification prevention, rate limiting, deduplication
   - Validates audit entities and fetches client managers from assignments
   - Returns NotificationResult[] for multiple recipients

2. **‚úÖ COMPLETE:** `api.notification.createAuditUpdate` router endpoint exists  
   - Located at `src/server/api/routers/notification.ts:201-257`
   - Validates input and handles errors properly
   - Returns success/failure counts and detailed results

3. **‚úÖ COMPLETE:** Change detection already implemented in `updateAudit` mutation
   - Lines 98-99: Fetches previous values (`const previous = await ctx.db.audit.findUnique(...)`)
   - Lines 109-127: Detects changes and creates activity logs for both stage and status
   - **ONLY MISSING:** Notification trigger integration

### Phase 2: Streamlined Implementation (Only 1 Change Needed!)
4. **üöß IMPLEMENTATION:** Enhance `updateAudit` mutation notification triggers
   - **File:** `src/server/api/routers/audit.ts` 
   - **Location:** After lines 109-127 (existing change detection)
   - **Action:** Add notification service calls when stage/status changes detected
   - **Challenge:** Need to get client manager ID from `clients.assignedUserId`

### Phase 3: Implementation Steps
5. **Step 1:** Add client data fetch to get `assignedUserId` (client manager)
6. **Step 2:** Add notification triggers after existing change detection  
7. **Step 3:** Handle stage and status changes separately with proper values
8. **Step 4:** Add error handling wrapper to prevent affecting main operation

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation  
9. **Step 5:** Test with stage changes, status changes, and combined changes
10. **Step 6:** Verify client manager notifications work correctly
11. **Step 7:** Confirm self-notification prevention works

## 4. Rules
*Keep rules relevant to current phase*

### Current Phase Rules (FETCHING_TASK)
- Task 3 successfully completed and marked as done
- Next task (Task 4) is available and ready for processing
- Ready to begin next iteration

## 5. Items

### üîÑ Current Implementation Progress
- **Phase 1:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Infrastructure assessment (notification service, API endpoints, change detection exist)
- **Phase 2:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Streamlined implementation (enhanced updateAudit mutation with notification triggers)
- **Phase 3:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Implementation steps (client data fetch, notification triggers, error handling)
- **Phase 4:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Testing & validation (31/34 tests passing, 3 UI test failures unrelated to changes)

### üìù Backup State Created
- **Timestamp:** 2025-01-23 02:30:00
- **Files to be modified:**
  - `src/server/api/routers/audit.ts`

### üö® Timeout Protection Status
- **Command timeout awareness:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE
- **Background execution:** Set to false for all commands
- **Timeout monitoring:** Will track all command execution times

### ‚úÖ Completed Items (Task 3)
- Read project configuration and existing notification router implementation
- Added `getUnread` query endpoint with pagination support
- Added `getCount` query endpoint for unread notification count
- Enhanced `markAsRead` mutation to support single notification ID
- Added `subscribe` placeholder endpoint with real-time implementation notes
- Created comprehensive test suite with timeout configuration (11 tests)
- Fixed test data to use valid UUIDs
