# Workflow State (STM) - 2025-01-23 02:09:00

## 🚨 CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Prisma: 60s | TypeScript: 90s

**⚠️ Commands that commonly hang:** pnpm install, npm test, git push, prisma db push, next build, tsc --noEmit

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMMITTING`
- **Status:** `VALIDATION_COMPLETE`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID:** 9
- **Title:** Implement Multi-device Read Status Synchronization
- **Description:** Ensure notification read status is synchronized across multiple devices for the same user.
- **Status:** pending
- **Dependencies:** [3, 4] ✅ Both complete
- **Priority:** low
- **Complexity Score:** 7 (manageable)
- **Subtasks:** 5 subtasks identified
- **Details:** Enhance the markAsRead and markAllAsRead mutations to broadcast read status changes to all connected clients. Update the frontend subscription handler to process read status updates from other sessions. Implement optimistic UI updates for read status changes to improve perceived performance. Add logic to handle conflicts when multiple devices attempt to mark the same notification as read. Ensure the unread count badge updates in real-time across all devices when a notification is read on any device.
- **Test Strategy:** Test with multiple browser sessions for the same user. Verify read status synchronizes across sessions. Test conflict resolution with simultaneous read operations. Measure performance impact of synchronization.

## 3. Validation Notes
- **Dependencies Status:** ✅ Tasks 3 & 4 are both marked as "done"
- **Current Architecture Analysis:**
  - Notification router exists but has placeholder subscription (polling-based)
  - Frontend uses polling every 30 seconds for "real-time" updates  
  - markAsRead/markAllAsRead mutations exist but don't broadcast changes
  - No multi-device synchronization currently implemented
- **Task Complexity:** Score 7 is manageable, good subtask breakdown provided
- **Ready for Implementation:** Yes, clear requirements and existing foundation

## 3. Plan

### Multi-device Read Status Synchronization Implementation Plan

**Current Architecture Analysis:**
- Next.js 15 App Router with tRPC v11
- Notification system exists with markAsRead/markAllAsRead mutations  
- Frontend uses polling (30s interval) instead of real-time subscriptions
- No WebSocket infrastructure or real-time broadcasting implemented
- Need to add WebSocket support for true real-time multi-device sync

### Phase 1: WebSocket Infrastructure Setup (Subtasks 1 & 4)
1. **Install WebSocket Dependencies**
   - Add `ws` and `@types/ws` packages
   - Add WebSocket client dependencies for tRPC

2. **Create WebSocket Server Integration**
   - Create `src/server/websocket.ts` for WebSocket server setup
   - Integrate with existing tRPC router using `applyWSSHandler`
   - Add WebSocket endpoint configuration for Next.js

3. **Add Event Broadcasting System**
   - Create `src/server/services/eventEmitter.ts` with global EventEmitter
   - Add broadcast capabilities to notification mutations
   - Implement conflict resolution logic for simultaneous reads

### Phase 2: Backend Real-time Mutations (Subtask 1)
1. **Enhance markAsRead Mutation**
   - Add event broadcasting to all user sessions
   - Include notification IDs and read status in broadcast
   - Implement optimistic conflict resolution

2. **Enhance markAllAsRead Mutation**  
   - Add bulk read status broadcasting
   - Send unread count updates to all user devices
   - Handle race conditions between devices

3. **Replace Placeholder Subscription**
   - Convert `subscribe` endpoint from query to true subscription
   - Use EventEmitter with proper user filtering
   - Add connection state management and cleanup

### Phase 3: Frontend Real-time Integration (Subtask 2)
1. **Add WebSocket Link to tRPC Client**
   - Update `src/app/_trpc/Provider.tsx` with splitLink configuration
   - Use `wsLink` for subscriptions, `httpBatchLink` for queries/mutations
   - Add WebSocket client with reconnection logic

2. **Update NotificationDropdown Component**
   - Replace polling-based subscription with true tRPC subscription
   - Add real-time read status event handling  
   - Update unread count badge in real-time

### Phase 4: Optimistic UI Updates (Subtask 3)  
1. **Implement Optimistic Read Actions**
   - Immediate UI updates on notification click
   - Local state management with server confirmation
   - Rollback logic for failed operations

2. **Add Conflict Resolution UI**
   - Handle concurrent read operations gracefully
   - Show user feedback for resolved conflicts
   - Maintain UI consistency across all devices

### Phase 5: Real-time Unread Count Sync (Subtask 5)
1. **Enhance Badge Updates**
   - Connect unread count to WebSocket events
   - Implement real-time badge synchronization
   - Add smooth animation for count changes

2. **Cross-device State Management**
   - Ensure consistent read state across all devices
   - Handle offline/online state transitions
   - Add connection status indicators

### Phase 6: Testing & Integration
1. **Multi-device Testing**
   - Test with multiple browser sessions  
   - Verify read status synchronization accuracy
   - Test conflict resolution scenarios

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure WebSocket connection overhead
   - Test subscription scalability
   - Validate reconnection behavior

### Technical Implementation Details

**WebSocket Server Setup:**
```typescript
// src/server/websocket.ts
import { applyWSSHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/ws';
import ws from 'ws';
import { appRouter } from './api/root';
import { createTRPCContext } from './api/trpc';
```

**Event Broadcasting Pattern:**
```typescript
// Emit read status changes to all user sessions
ee.emit(`notification:read:${userId}`, {
  notificationIds: ['id1', 'id2'],
  isRead: true,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

**tRPC Client Configuration:**
```typescript
// splitLink for WebSocket subscriptions + HTTP queries/mutations
splitLink({
  condition: (op) => op.type === 'subscription',
  true: wsLink({ client: wsClient }),
  false: httpBatchLink({ url: '/api/trpc' })
})
```

**Multi-device Subscription:**
```typescript
// Real-time notification read status subscription
onReadStatusChange: subscription with user filtering
// Broadcasts: { notificationIds, isRead, unreadCount }
```

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ Read status syncs instantly across all user devices
- ✅ Unread count badge updates in real-time  
- ✅ Conflict resolution handles simultaneous operations
- ✅ WebSocket connections reconnect automatically
- ✅ Optimistic UI provides immediate feedback
- ✅ No performance degradation from real-time features
