# Workflow State (STM) - 2025-01-23 02:09:00

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMMITTING`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Task ID: 2 - "Create Notification Service" (from task-master next)
- **Parsed Task Description:** Develop a comprehensive notification service that handles message templating, notification creation, and implements smart notification logic. Create src/server/services/notificationService.ts with functions for different notification types (createClientAssignment, createAuditAssignment, createAuditUpdate). Implement React-compatible message formatting, self-notification prevention, deduplication, entity validation, and rate limiting.
- **Implementation Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** Task 1 (completed)
- **Complexity Assessment:** High (8/10) - Complex service layer with 7 subtasks, multiple advanced features (templating, rate limiting, deduplication), requires comprehensive testing
- **Estimated Files to Modify:** 3-5 files (notification service, types, tests, potentially utilities)
- **Checkpoint Markers:** None required (service layer implementation, no database/security changes)
- **Subtasks Count:** 7 subtasks with clear dependency chain
- **Context Gathered:** Need to gather information about existing service patterns, React component composition approaches, and notification requirements

## 3. Plan
*(Detailed step-by-step implementation plan created during BLUEPRINT phase)*

### Overview
Develop a comprehensive notification service layer that handles message templating, notification creation, and implements smart notification logic. Build `src/server/services/notificationService.ts` with functions for different notification types, React-compatible message formatting, self-notification prevention, deduplication, entity validation, and rate limiting. Follow project patterns: class-based services, Winston logging, tRPC integration, and comprehensive testing.

### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Create NotificationMessage Type Structure**
- Create `src/types/notification.ts` with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Define `NotificationMessage` interface with message content, formatting options, metadata, React component composition support
- Include properties: sender, recipient, timestamp, priority level, notification status, type-specific data
- Create supporting interfaces: `NotificationRecipient`, `NotificationSender`, `NotificationMetadata`
- Support different notification types: client_assignment, audit_assignment, audit_stage_update, audit_status_update
- Files to create: `src/types/notification.ts`
- Expected outcome: Complete type system for notification data structures

**Step 2: Implement Message Templating System**
- Create helper functions for React-compatible message formatting in notification service
- Implement template generators for each notification type that populate NotificationMessage structure
- Use React component composition patterns (children: ReactNode) instead of HTML strings
- Support dynamic content insertion, conditional formatting based on notification type
- Design system to be extensible for future template additions
- Include internationalization placeholders (i18n ready)
- Files to modify: notification service (templating methods)
- Expected outcome: Flexible templating system with React-compatible output

**Step 3: Create User Lookup and Entity Validation Functions**
- Implement utility functions for user information lookup using Prisma
- Create validation functions for entities: clients, audits, assignments existence checks
- Implement error handling for missing/invalid entities using TRPCError patterns
- Add proper TypeScript typing for entity validation results
- Include performance optimization (batch lookups where possible)
- Files to modify: notification service (utility methods)
- Expected outcome: Robust entity validation with proper error handling

**Step 4: Implement Core Notification Creation Functions**
- Create the three main notification functions: `createClientAssignment`, `createAuditAssignment`, `createAuditUpdate`
- Each function accepts appropriate parameters, validates inputs using Zod-like patterns
- Generate notification messages using templating system
- Return properly formatted NotificationMessage objects
- Include proper error handling, logging with Winston logger
- Use Prisma transactions for database operations following project patterns
- Files to modify: notification service (core methods)
- Expected outcome: Complete notification creation API with proper validation

**Step 5: Develop Self-Notification Prevention and Deduplication Logic**
- Add logic to skip notifications when creator === recipient (self-notification prevention)
- Implement deduplication that checks for identical notifications within configurable time window
- Create mechanism to compare notification content and metadata for duplicates
- Use database query approach with Prisma for recent notification checking
- Include configurable time windows for different notification types
- Files to modify: notification service (prevention/deduplication methods)
- Expected outcome: Smart notification logic that prevents spam and self-notifications

**Step 6: Implement Rate Limiting Functionality**
- Develop rate limiting mechanism restricting notifications per user within time periods
- Implement configurable thresholds for different notification types and priorities
- Create storage solution using database to track notification counts and timestamps
- Add logic to queue/delay notifications exceeding rate limits
- Ensure important notifications (high priority) are still delivered appropriately
- Include cleanup mechanism for old rate limiting data
- Files to modify: notification service (rate limiting methods)
- Expected outcome: Complete rate limiting system with priority-based exceptions

**Step 7: Integrate and Test the Complete Notification Service**
- Create main `NotificationService` class following EmailService pattern
- Export all notification functions and utilities in organized manner
- Implement proper error handling, logging with Winston, performance monitoring
- Write comprehensive unit tests for each component (template generation, creation, deduplication, rate limiting)
- Create integration tests for complete notification workflow
- Add proper JSDoc documentation for all public APIs
- Files to create: `src/server/services/notificationService.ts`, test files
- Expected outcome: Production-ready notification service with complete test coverage

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each notification creation function, template generation, entity validation, rate limiting logic
- **Integration Tests**: Complete workflow from creation to database storage, deduplication scenarios
- **Mock Tests**: Database interactions isolated, external service dependencies mocked
- **Edge Case Tests**: Self-notifications, missing entities, rate limit exceeded, duplicate notifications
- **Performance Tests**: Verify rate limiting doesn't impact normal operations, batch operations efficiency

### File Structure
```
src/types/notification.ts           - Type definitions
src/server/services/notificationService.ts - Main service class  
src/server/services/__tests__/notificationService.test.ts - Unit tests
scripts/test-notification-service.ts - Integration test script
```

### Quality Gates
- All notification types properly templated and validated
- Self-notification prevention working correctly
- Deduplication logic prevents spam notifications
- Rate limiting respects configured thresholds
- Entity validation prevents invalid notifications
- Complete test coverage with passing unit and integration tests
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- TypeScript compilation with no errors
- ESLint and Prettier standards maintained

### Dependencies Integration
- **Prisma**: Database operations, entity lookups, notification storage
- **Winston**: Logging throughout the service
- **React Types**: ReactNode for component composition in templates
- **Zod**: Input validation (following tRPC patterns)
- **Project Types**: Existing User, Client, Audit types from Prisma client
