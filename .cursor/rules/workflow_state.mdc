# Workflow State (STM) - 2025-01-23 02:09:00

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Prisma: 60s | TypeScript: 90s

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** pnpm install, npm test, git push, prisma db push, next build, tsc --noEmit

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMMITTING`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Task ID: 5 - "Integrate Client Assignment Notifications"
- **Parsed Task Description:** Add notification triggers for client assignment changes in client creation and update flows. Modify api.clients.update and api.clients.create mutations to trigger notifications when assignedUserId changes. In EditClientModal.tsx and AddClientModal.tsx, add logic to detect assignment changes and call notificationService.createClientAssignment with appropriate parameters (assignedUserId, clientId, clientName, createdByUserId). Ensure self-notification prevention by comparing assignedUserId with session.user.id. Add error handling to prevent notification failures from affecting the main operation.
- **Implementation Priority:** medium
- **Dependencies:** Task 2 (completed) ‚úÖ, Task 3 (completed) ‚úÖ
- **Complexity Score:** 5
- **Test Strategy:** Test client creation and updates with different assignment scenarios. Verify notifications are created with correct data. Confirm self-assignments don't create notifications. Test error handling by simulating notification service failures.

### Subtasks:
1. **Subtask 5.1:** Implement notificationService.createClientAssignment method
2. **Subtask 5.2:** Modify api.clients.create mutation to trigger notifications
3. **Subtask 5.3:** Update AddClientModal.tsx with notification logic
4. **Subtask 5.4:** Implement notification triggers in api.clients.update and EditClientModal.tsx

## 3. Plan

### Phase 1: Notification Service Method (Subtask 5.1)
1. **Analysis Complete:** ‚úÖ NotificationService.createClientAssignmentNotification already exists
   - Located at `src/server/services/notificationService.ts:381-466`
   - Properly implements self-notification prevention
   - Includes entity validation, rate limiting, and deduplication
   - Returns NotificationResult with success/failure status
   - **Conclusion:** This subtask is already complete

### Phase 2: Client Creation API Enhancement (Subtask 5.2)
2. **Analyze existing api.clients.create mutation:**
   - Located at `src/server/api/routers/client.ts` (find create mutation)
   - Currently missing notification trigger logic
   - Need to add notification service call after successful client creation

3. **Implement notification trigger in client creation:**
   - Import NotificationService in client router
   - Add notification call after successful client creation
   - Wrap in try/catch to prevent affecting main operation
   - Include self-notification prevention check

### Phase 3: AddClientModal Enhancement (Subtask 5.3)
4. **Add assignedUserId field to AddClientModal:**
   - Add assignedUserId to clientFormSchema (z.string().uuid().nullable().optional())
   - Import assignable managers query: `api.user.getAssignableManagers.useQuery()`
   - Add assigned user dropdown field between status and phone fields
   - Update form default values to include assignedUserId: null
   - Update createPayload to include assignedUserId field

5. **Test AddClientModal integration:**
   - Ensure assignedUserId is passed to API correctly
   - Verify notification is triggered on backend (handled by API)

### Phase 4: Client Update API Enhancement (Subtask 5.4 - Part 1)
6. **Enhance api.clients.update mutation:**
   - Current implementation already fetches oldClient for assignment detection
   - Add NotificationService import and notification triggering logic
   - Add notification call when assignedUserId changes
   - Include self-notification prevention check

### Phase 5: EditClientModal Integration (Subtask 5.4 - Part 2)
7. **Verify EditClientModal integration:**
   - Already has assignedUserId field and managers dropdown
   - Already passes assignedUserId to API correctly
   - Notification triggering will be handled by enhanced API
   - No changes needed to EditClientModal

### Phase 6: Testing Implementation
8. **Create comprehensive tests:**
   - Test client creation with various assignment scenarios
   - Test client updates with assignment changes
   - Test self-notification prevention
   - Test error handling for notification failures
   - Verify notifications contain correct data

9. **Integration testing:**
   - Test complete flow: AddClientModal ‚Üí API ‚Üí NotificationService
   - Test complete flow: EditClientModal ‚Üí API ‚Üí NotificationService
   - Verify notification delivery and content
   - Test error scenarios and graceful degradation

### Technical Implementation Details:
- **API Pattern:** Call NotificationService.createClientAssignmentNotification after successful DB operations
- **Error Handling:** Wrap notification calls in try/catch blocks to prevent affecting main operations
- **Self-Notification:** Compare assignedUserId with session.user.id before triggering notification
- **Parameter Mapping:** 
  - assignedUserId ‚Üí managerId (NotificationService parameter)
  - clientId ‚Üí clientId
  - clientName ‚Üí from created/updated client data
  - session.user.id ‚Üí createdByUserId
- **Notification Triggering:** Only when assignedUserId is provided and differs from session.user.id

### Files to Modify:
1. `src/server/api/routers/client.ts` - Add notification triggers to create/update mutations
2. `src/components/clients/AddClientModal.tsx` - Add assignedUserId field and dropdown
3. Create test files for new notification integration functionality

### Dependencies Check:
- ‚úÖ NotificationService exists and is functional (Task 2 completed)
- ‚úÖ Notification infrastructure exists (Task 3 completed)
- ‚úÖ Client API mutations exist and are functional
- ‚úÖ Client modal components exist and are functional
