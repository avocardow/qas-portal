# Workflow State (STM) - 2025-01-23 02:09:00

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Prisma: 60s | TypeScript: 90s

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** pnpm install, npm test, git push, prisma db push, next build, tsc --noEmit

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `CONSTRUCT`
- **Status:** `PLAN_APPROVED`

## 2. Current Task
**Task 10 - Performance Optimization and Testing**
- **Task ID:** 10
- **Title:** Performance Optimization and Testing
- **Description:** Optimize notification system performance and conduct comprehensive testing.
- **Status:** pending
- **Dependencies:** [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] ‚úÖ All complete
- **Priority:** low
- **Complexity Score:** 9 (high complexity)
- **Subtasks:** 7 subtasks identified
- **Details:** Implement pagination for large notification lists to improve loading performance. Add connection pooling for WebSocket connections to reduce server load. Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts. Add monitoring for notification service performance. Optimize database queries with proper indexing. Conduct load testing with high notification volumes. Implement accessibility improvements including screen reader announcements for new notifications. Add responsive design adjustments for mobile notification viewing. Create comprehensive test suite covering all notification scenarios.
- **Test Strategy:** Conduct performance testing with simulated high loads. Measure response times and resource usage. Test with screen readers for accessibility compliance. Verify mobile responsiveness on different devices. Run integration tests covering the full notification lifecycle. Test error recovery scenarios and connection reliability.

## 3. Validation Notes
- **Dependencies Check:** All dependencies (Tasks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are completed ‚úÖ
- **Task Complexity:** High (9/10) - Breaking down into logical phases
- **Scope Analysis:** Performance optimization across multiple areas (WebSocket, database, UI, testing)

  - No Redis currently configured (need to add for caching)
  - No monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana need setup)
  - Some basic indexing exists from previous PRD migration
  - WebSocket infrastructure already implemented in Task 9
  - Basic metrics collection available in Prisma

   - Implement health checks and idle connection cleanup
   - Add metrics collection for pool usage

4. **Implement Exponential Backoff for Reconnection (Subtask 10.3)**
   - Enhance existing WebSocket client with backoff algorithm
   - Add randomized jitter to prevent thundering herd
   - Implement connection state machine and user feedback
   - Create fallback to polling when WebSocket unavailable

### **Phase 3: Monitoring & Observability (Subtask 4)**
5. **Set Up Monitoring for Notification Service (Subtask 10.4)**
   - Install and configure Prometheus metrics collection
   - Set up Grafana dashboard for notification system KPIs
   - Implement structured logging with Winston (already available)
   - Add health check endpoints for service monitoring
   - Create custom metrics for notification delivery rates and latency

### **Phase 4: Load Testing & Accessibility (Subtask 6)**
6. **Conduct Load Testing and Implement UI Improvements (Subtask 10.6)**
