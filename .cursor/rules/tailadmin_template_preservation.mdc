- **Preserve TailAdmin Template Pages**
  - After customizing a TailAdmin template page, retain the original by renaming it with `_backup` (e.g., `Dashboard_backup.tsx`) so it's not served at its original URL.
  - Do not delete or overwrite the original template file; keeping backups ensures consistency and a reference for future scaffolding.

- **Preserve TailAdmin Template Components**
  - After customizing a TailAdmin template component that will no longer be used, rename the original with a `_template` suffix (e.g., `Sidebar_template.tsx`) for future reference and to avoid naming conflicts.
  - Do not remove or override original components; templates should guide the creation of new components to maintain styling and structure.

- **Always Scaffold from Templates**
  - New pages and components must be created by copying from existing TailAdmin templates rather than coding from scratch.
  - Templates live in `src/app/(tailadmin)/(admin)`, `src/app/(tailadmin)/(full-width-pages)`, and `src/components` directories, whereas our customized page templates live in `src/app/(pages)/`; referencing these ensures adherence to design and code standards.

**Examples**

```tsx
// src/pages/Dashboard_backup.tsx
// Original TailAdmin template renamed as backup
```

```tsx
// src/components/Sidebar_template.tsx
// Original TailAdmin component kept for reference
```
