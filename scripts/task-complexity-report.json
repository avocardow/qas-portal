      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of tRPC CRUD procedures for Client records with RBAC into subtasks, including server-side sorting/filtering/pagination, relation loading, Zod schema validation, and field-level access control for different roles.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple CRUD operations, complex RBAC enforcement, server-side data handling (sorting, filtering, pagination), and relation management. The need for field-level access control and robust validation increases both cyclomatic and functional complexity, requiring careful breakdown and thorough testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for implementing tRPC CRUD procedures for Contacts, Licenses, and Trust Accounts, including Zod validation, RBAC enforcement, parent-child relationship handling, and potential batch operations.",
      "reasoning": "While similar in structure to Task 1, this task focuses on related entities with less complex relationships and fewer operations per entity. However, RBAC, validation, and potential batch operations still add moderate complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Identify subtasks for building Client List and Detail pages with CRUD forms, role-based UI controls, data table features, and consistent styling using React, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI.",
      "reasoning": "This frontend task requires integrating advanced data table features, conditional UI rendering based on roles, complex forms with validation, and consistent component styling, all of which contribute to significant implementation and integration complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for implementing tRPC audit procedures, including audit creation, stage/status updates, assignment management, RBAC enforcement, and relation handling.",
      "reasoning": "Audit tracking involves multiple interrelated procedures, assignment logic, and strict RBAC. The need to manage audit stages, statuses, and assignments increases both the logical and control flow complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of tRPC procedures for retrieving document references by Client, Audit, and Task, including RBAC enforcement and metadata handling.",
      "reasoning": "This backend task is relatively straightforward, focusing on read-only procedures with RBAC and metadata handling, resulting in lower overall complexity."
