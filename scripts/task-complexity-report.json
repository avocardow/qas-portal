    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Personal Email Integration",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of personal M365 email integration into backend API development, Graph API permissions setup, frontend UI layout, pagination, compose/reply/forward modals, HTML sanitization, and robust loading/error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires full-stack development, secure integration with Microsoft Graph API, complex UI/UX (3-column layout, modals), and careful handling of email content (HTML sanitization, error/loading states). Each component is interdependent and must be robust, making the overall complexity high."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Admin Shared Mailbox Access",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to extend email integration for shared mailbox access, including backend procedure updates, additional API permissions, RBAC enforcement, UI mailbox switcher, component adaptation, and correct email attribution.",
      "reasoning": "This builds on the personal email integration, adding role-based access control, new API endpoints, and UI logic for mailbox switching. While leveraging existing infrastructure, it introduces new security and attribution challenges, raising complexity moderately."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance Client and Audit Detail Pages",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the enhancement of Client and Audit detail pages into API optimization for relational data, tabbed interface design, table/list creation with sorting/filtering, audit page improvements, consistent component usage, and responsive design.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant backend optimization for relational data, advanced frontend UI/UX (tabs, tables, responsive design), and consistent use of design systems. The breadth of entities and data relationships increases the implementation complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Teams Chat Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide Teams chat integration into backend chat API creation, Graph API permission setup, chat UI layout, message pagination/infinite scroll, user search, chat creation flows, and error/loading state management.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating real-time chat requires backend and frontend coordination, handling of chat history, user search, and new chat flows. The need for reliable state management and responsive UI increases complexity, especially with Microsoft Graph API integration."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Teams Phone Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Teams Phone integration into backend call procedures, Graph API permissions, call log schema design, phone UI with search, call buttons, admin dial pad, call logging, and RBAC for phone features.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves telephony integration, secure API usage, database design for call logs, and nuanced UI/UX for different roles. Handling real-time events and ensuring accurate logging add to the technical and operational complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement SharePoint Folder Linking",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the SharePoint folder linking process into automated script development, backend API for folder access, RBAC for linking, UI for folder selection, document display, and web link integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines backend scripting, API integration, RBAC, and UI for folder management. While leveraging SharePoint APIs, it requires careful mapping and user interaction design, making it moderately complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement UI Polish and Theme Switcher",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand UI polish and theme switcher into feedback review, UI refinement, design system consistency, responsive improvements, theme switcher implementation, and theme persistence.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a frontend/UI task involving design consistency and theme management. While important for user experience, it is less technically complex than deep integrations or backend-heavy tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Integration Testing and Final Polishing",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down integration testing and final polish into end-to-end test creation, cross-component interaction testing, PRD acceptance verification, performance optimization, error/feedback consistency, UI/UX fixes, documentation updates, and cross-browser/device testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task is the culmination of all previous work, requiring comprehensive testing, bug fixing, performance tuning, and documentation. It demands coordination across all features and systems, making it the most complex and critical phase."
