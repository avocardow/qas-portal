      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up App Router folder structure",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of designing and creating the Next.js App Router folder structure, including: analyzing the sitemap, mapping routes to folder groups, creating protected and public route groups, setting up subfolders for each route, and documenting the structure according to Next.js best practices.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves architectural decisions, mapping the sitemap to Next.js route groups, and ensuring proper separation of protected and public routes. It requires understanding Next.js routing conventions and best practices, but is relatively straightforward once the sitemap is clear.[1][2][3][4][5]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create placeholder page components",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to generate minimal page.tsx components for each route, including: creating files, adding headings and messages, applying correct layouts, following naming conventions, and ensuring TypeScript typing.",
      "reasoning": "This is a repetitive but simple task focused on scaffolding. The main complexity is ensuring consistency and adherence to layout and naming conventions, as well as TypeScript typing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Define Prisma schema for client data",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to design and implement a Prisma schema for client data migration, including: modeling entities, defining relationships, validating schema design against best practices, and preparing for future extensibility.",
      "reasoning": "Designing a relational schema with proper relationships and future extensibility requires careful planning and understanding of both the data and Prisma conventions. Mistakes here can have downstream effects."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CSV parsing functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps to implement robust CSV parsing, including: configuring the parser, reading files, mapping data to models, cleaning and validating data, handling edge cases, and logging results.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing and transforming CSV data is error-prone, especially with edge cases like missing fields and data inconsistencies. Proper validation and logging are crucial for reliable migration."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Prisma database seeding",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Enumerate the steps to extend the migration script for database seeding, including: initializing Prisma Client, handling transactions and relationships, implementing error handling and rollback, supporting dry runs, and ensuring idempotency.",
      "reasoning": "Database seeding with transactional integrity, relationship handling, and idempotency is complex. Error handling and rollback add further challenges, especially when integrating with Supabase."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Configure CI environment for Supabase",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps to configure the CI environment for Supabase, including: setting environment variables, updating configuration files, documenting requirements, validating connections, and managing secrets.",
      "reasoning": "CI configuration involves multiple systems (CI, Supabase, environment management), and mistakes can expose secrets or break deployments. Documentation and validation are important for reliability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement navigation between routes",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to add basic navigation between placeholder pages, including: creating navigation components, integrating them into layouts, using Next.js Link, and indicating the active route.",
      "reasoning": "This is a straightforward UI task with minimal complexity, mainly requiring knowledge of Next.js navigation and layout integration."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create documentation and verification guide",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Describe the steps to create comprehensive documentation and a verification guide, including: documenting folder structure, migration script usage, data verification steps, listing placeholder pages, and outlining next development steps.",
      "reasoning": "Documentation is essential but not technically complex. The main challenge is ensuring clarity, completeness, and adherence to project conventions."
