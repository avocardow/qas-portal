    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Database Schema Migration for Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema migration into subtasks covering: requirements review, migration script creation, adding columns and constraints, implementing indexes, enum constraint enforcement, rollback script development, and comprehensive migration testing.",
      "reasoning": "Database schema migrations are moderately complex due to the need for careful planning, rollback capability, and ensuring data integrity. Best practices include documentation, version control, automation, and thorough testing, all of which require distinct subtasks for a robust migration process.[1][5]"

    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create Notification Service",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the notification service implementation into subtasks for: service scaffolding, message templating, notification logic (creation, deduplication, self-notification prevention), entity validation, rate limiting, helper utilities, and comprehensive unit/integration testing.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a notification service involves multiple layers: message formatting, business logic, validation, and performance considerations. Implementing deduplication, rate limiting, and React-compatible templating adds to the complexity, requiring careful modularization and testing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement tRPC Notification Router",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tRPC router implementation into subtasks for: endpoint scaffolding, query/mutation logic, subscription setup, authentication/validation, user filtering, and router integration with the main API.",
      "reasoning": "Building a tRPC router with real-time subscriptions, authentication, and multiple endpoints is moderately complex. Security, validation, and integration with the notification service require careful attention and clear separation of concerns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance NotificationDropdown Component",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the component enhancement into subtasks for: integrating real-time subscriptions, unread badge display, click-to-navigate and read marking, connection status/auto-reconnect, and message formatting with React components.",
      "reasoning": "Enhancing a UI component for real-time updates and optimistic UI requires frontend expertise, but is less complex than backend service design. The main challenges are state management, UX, and integrating with the notification system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Client Assignment Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration into subtasks for: mutation modification, assignment change detection, notification trigger logic, and error handling to isolate notification failures.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating notification triggers into existing flows is straightforward but requires careful handling of edge cases (self-notification, error isolation). The logic is well-scoped and mostly involves code changes in specific areas."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Audit Assignment Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the integration into subtasks for: updating audit assignment mutation, detecting assignment changes, triggering notifications, and implementing robust error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to client assignment, this task involves integrating notification logic into existing flows. The complexity is moderate, mainly due to the need for accurate change detection and error handling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Audit Progress Update Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation into subtasks for: mutation update for stage/status changes, change detection logic, notification trigger for client managers, self-notification prevention, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task adds complexity due to the need to compare previous and new values, determine notification recipients, and prevent self-notifications. It requires careful logic to ensure correct and non-redundant notifications."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Browser Push Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide browser notification implementation into subtasks for: permission management, notification creation, context-aware permission requests, click handling/navigation, permission state management, and graceful fallback logic.",
      "reasoning": "Browser push notifications involve dealing with browser APIs, permission flows, and cross-platform nuances. Ensuring a seamless user experience and fallback mechanisms adds to the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Multi-device Read Status Synchronization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand synchronization into subtasks for: backend broadcast logic, frontend subscription handler updates, optimistic UI implementation, conflict resolution for concurrent updates, and real-time badge update logic.",
      "reasoning": "Synchronizing read status across devices requires real-time communication, conflict handling, and UI consistency. The need for robust backend and frontend coordination increases the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Testing",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down optimization and testing into subtasks for: pagination implementation, WebSocket connection pooling, reconnection/backoff logic, monitoring setup, query/index optimization, load/accessibility/responsive testing, and comprehensive test suite creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the breadth of concerns: performance, scalability, monitoring, accessibility, and comprehensive testing. Each area requires specialized knowledge and thorough implementation to ensure system robustness."
